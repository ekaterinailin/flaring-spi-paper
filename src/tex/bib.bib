	abstract = {Heliophysics is the system science of the physical connections between the Sun and the solar system. As the physics of the local cosmos, it embraces space weather and planetary habitability. The wider view of comparative heliophysics forms a template for conditions in exoplanetary systems and provides a view over time of the aging Sun and its magnetic activity, of the heliosphere in different settings of the interstellar medium and subject to stellar impacts, of the space physics over evolving planetary dynamos, and of the long-term influence on planetary atmospheres by stellar radiation and wind. Based on a series of NASA-funded summer schools for early-career researchers, this textbook is intended for students in physical sciences in later years of their university training and for beginning graduate students in fields of solar, stellar, (exo-)planetary, and planetary-system sciences. The book emphasizes universal processes from a perspective that draws attention to what provides Earth (and similar (exo-)planets) with a relatively stable setting in which life as we know it could thrive. The text includes 200 "Activities" in the form of exercises, explorations, literature readings, "what if" challenges, and group discussion topics; many of the Activities provide additional information complementing the main text. Solutions and discussions are included in an Appendix for a selection of the exercises.},

	abstract = {Massive planets in very close orbits around their central stars can induce so-called star-planet interactions (SPI), which may be of magnetic or gravitational nature. In both cases, SPI can potentially cause recurring chromospheric emission on the host star visible in Ca II H \& K and/or Hα. The emission would be bound to the planetary orbit, not to the rotation period of the star. We searched for SPI in a sample of 7 stars with massive close-in planets using high-resolution spectroscopic data taken at HRS (HET) and FEROS (La Silla). We find no periodically recurring emission in the planet-hosting stars. In the case of HD 41004 AB, a binary system consisting of a K dwarf and an M dwarf, where the M dwarf is orbited by a brown dwarf companion, we find signs of cyclic variation in the Ca II K and Hα emission lines that could be associated to interactions between the M dwarf and its companion. We present our first results of this interesting system that may become an important system for the understanding of SPI.},

	abstract = {The Hill stability criterion is applied to analyse the stability of a planet in the binary star system of HD 41004 AB, with the primary and secondary separated by 22 AU, and masses of 0.7 M\_⊙ and 0.4 M\_⊙, respectively. The primary hosts one planet in an S-type orbit, and the secondary hosts a brown dwarf (18.64 M\_J) on a relatively close orbit, 0.0177 AU, thereby forming another binary pair within this binary system. This star-brown dwarf pair (HD 41004 B+Bb) is considered a single body during our numerical calculations, while the dynamics of the planet around the primary, HD 41004 Ab, is studied in different phase-spaces. HD 41004 Ab is a 2.6 M\_J planet orbiting at the distance of 1.7 AU with orbital eccentricity 0.39. For the purpose of this study, the system is reduced to a three-body problem and is solved numerically as the elliptic restricted three-body problem (ERTBP). The \{Hill stability\} function is used as a chaos indicator to configure and analyse the orbital stability of the planet, HD 41004 Ab. The indicator has been effective in measuring the planet's orbital perturbation due to the secondary star during its periastron passage. The calculated Hill stability time series of the planet for the coplanar case shows the stable and quasi-periodic orbits for at least ten million years. For the reduced ERTBP the stability of the system is also studied for different values of planet's orbital inclination with the binary plane. Also, by recording the planet's \{ejection time\} from the system or \{collision time\} with a star during the integration period, stability of the system is analysed in a bigger phase-space of the planet's orbital inclination, ≤ 90o, and its semimajor axis, 1.65-1.75 AU. Based on our analysis it is found that the system can maintain a stable configuration for the planet's orbital inclination as high as 65o relative to the binary plane. The results from the Hill stability criterion and the planet's dynamical lifetime map are found to be consistent with each other.},

The planet was identified by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and was confirmed with the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher radial velocities. Seeing-limited photometry and speckle imaging rule out nearby eclipsing binaries. Additional transits were observed with the LCOGT, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Spitzer,{\textless}i/{\textgreater} and ExTrA telescopes. We characterise the star to have a mass of 0.519 ± 0.013 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and a radius of 0.516 ± 0.016 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. We modelled the transit light curves and radial velocity measurements and obtained a planetary mass of 3.34 ± 0.72 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}E{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, a radius of 2.13 ± 0.11 {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}E{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, and a mean density of g cm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. The low density of the planet implies the presence of volatiles, and its radius and insolation place it immediately above the radius valley at the lower end of the mini-Neptune cluster. A coupled atmospheric and dynamical evolution analysis of the planet is inconsistent with a pure H–He atmosphere and favours a heavy mean molecular weight atmosphere. The transmission spectroscopy metric of means that GJ 3090 b is the second or third most favorable mini-Neptune after GJ 1214 b whose atmosphere may be characterised. At almost half the mass of GJ 1214 b, GJ 3090 b is an excellent probe of the edge of the transition between super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. We identify an additional signal in the radial velocity data that we attribute to a planet candidate with an orbital period of 13 days and a mass of {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}E{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, whose transits are not detected.},

	abstract = {We measure star-spot filling fractions for 240 stars in the Pleiades and M67 open star clusters using APOGEE high-resolution H-band spectra. For this work, we developed a modified spectroscopic pipeline which solves for star-spot filling fraction and star-spot temperature contrast. We exclude binary stars, finding that the large majority of binaries in these clusters (80 per cent) can be identified from Gaia DR3 and APOGEE criteria - important for field star applications. Our data agree well with independent activity proxies, indicating that this technique recovers real star-spot signals. In the Pleiades, filling fractions saturate at a mean level of 0.248 ± 0.005 for active stars with a decline at slower rotation; we present fitting functions as a function of Rossby number. In M67, we recover low mean filling fractions of 0.030 ± 0.008 and 0.003 ± 0.002 for main sequence GK stars and evolved red giants, respectively, confirming that the technique does not produce spurious spot signals in inactive stars. Star-spots also modify the derived spectroscopic effective temperatures and convective overturn time-scales. Effective temperatures for active stars are offset from inactive ones by -109 ± 11 K, in agreement with the Pecaut \& Mamajek empirical scale. Star-spot filling fractions at the level measured in active stars changes their inferred overturn time-scale, which biases the derived threshold for saturation. Finally, we identify a population of stars statistically discrepant from mean activity-Rossby relations and present evidence that these are genuine departures from a Rossby scaling. Our technique is applicable to the full APOGEE catalogue, with broad applications to stellar, galactic, and exoplanetary astrophysics.},

	abstract = {Planets in synchronous rotation around low-mass stars are the most salient targets for current ground- and space-based missions to observe and characterize. Such model calculations can help to prioritize targets for observation with current and future missions; however, intrinsic differences in the complexity and physical parameterizations of various models can lead to different predictions of a planet's climate state. Understanding such model differences is necessary if such models are to guide target selection and aid in the analysis of observations. This paper presents a protocol to intercompare models of a hypothetical planet with a 15 day synchronous rotation period around a 3000 K blackbody star across a parameter space of surface pressure and incident instellation. We conduct a sparse sample of 16 cases from a previously published exploration of this parameter space with the ExoPlaSim model. By selecting particular cases across this broad parameter space, the SAMOSA intercomparison will identify areas where simpler models are sufficient as well as areas where more complex GCMs are required. Our preliminary comparison using ExoCAM shows general consistency between the climate state predicted by ExoCAM and ExoPlaSim except in regions of the parameter space most likely to be in a steam atmosphere or incipient runaway greenhouse state. We use this preliminary analysis to define several options for participation in the intercomparison by models of all levels of complexity. The participation of other GCMs is crucial to understand how the atmospheric states across this parameter space differ with model capabilities.},

	abstract = {The ExoClock project has been created with the aim of increasing the efficiency of the Ariel mission. It will achieve this by continuously monitoring and updating the ephemerides of Ariel candidates over an extended period, in order to produce a consistent catalogue of reliable and precise ephemerides. This work presents a homogenous catalogue of updated ephemerides for 450 planets, generated by the integration of \${\textbackslash}sim\$18000 data points from multiple sources. These sources include observations from ground-based telescopes (ExoClock network and ETD), mid-time values from the literature and light-curves from space telescopes (Kepler/K2 and TESS). With all the above, we manage to collect observations for half of the post-discovery years (median), with data that have a median uncertainty less than one minute. In comparison with literature, the ephemerides generated by the project are more precise and less biased. More than 40{\textbackslash}\% of the initial literature ephemerides had to be updated to reach the goals of the project, as they were either of low precision or drifting. Moreover, the integrated approach of the project enables both the monitoring of the majority of the Ariel candidates (95{\textbackslash}\%), and also the identification of missing data. The dedicated ExoClock network effectively supports this task by contributing additional observations when a gap in the data is identified. These results highlight the need for continuous monitoring to increase the observing coverage of the candidate planets. Finally, the extended observing coverage of planets allows us to detect trends (TTVs - Transit Timing Variations) for a sample of 19 planets. All products, data, and codes used in this work are open and accessible to the wider scientific community.},

	abstract = {We have analyzed homogeneous long-term photometric observations of 28 well-known weakline T Tauri stars (WTTS) and 60 WTTS candidates detected by the ROSAT observatory toward the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. We show that 22 known WTTS and 39 WTTS candidates exhibit periodic light variations that are attributable to the phenomenon of spotted rotational modulation. The rotation periods of these spotted stars lie within the range from 0.5 to 10 days. Significant differences between the long-term photometric behaviors of known WTTS and WTTS candidates have been found. We have calculated accurate luminosities, radii, masses, and ages for 74 stars. About 33\% of the sample of WTTS candidates have ages younger than 10 Myr. The mean distance to 24 WTTS candidates with reliable estimates of their radii is shown to be 143 ± 26 pc. This is in excellent agreement with the adopted distance to the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Atmospheric magnetic fields in stars with convective envelopes heat stellar chromospheres, and thus increase the observed flux in the Ca ii H and K doublet. Starting with the historical Mount Wilson monitoring program, these two spectral lines have been widely used to trace stellar magnetic activity, and as a proxy for rotation period ({\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}rot{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) and consequently for stellar age. Monitoring stellar activity has also become essential in filtering out false-positives due to magnetic activity in extra-solar planet surveys. The Ca ii emission is traditionally quantified through the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R'{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}HK{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}-index, which compares the chromospheric flux in the doublet to the overall bolometric flux of the star. Much work has been done to characterize this index for FGK-dwarfs, but M dwarfs – the most numerous stars of the Galaxy – were left out of these analyses and no calibration of their Ca ii H and K emission to an {\textless}i{\textgreater}R'{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}HK{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} exists to date.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We set out to characterize the magnetic activity of the low- and very-low-mass stars by providing a calibration of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R'{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}HK{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}-index that extends to the realm of M dwarfs, and by evaluating the relationship between {\textless}i{\textgreater}R'{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}HK{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and the rotation period.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We calibrated the bolometric and photospheric factors for M dwarfs to properly transform the {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-index (which compares the flux in the Ca ii H and K lines to a close spectral continuum) into the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R'{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}HK{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. We monitored magnetic activity through the Ca ii H and K emission lines in the HARPS M dwarf sample.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The {\textless}i{\textgreater}R'{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}HK{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} index, like the fractional X-ray luminosity {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}X{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/{\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}bol{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, shows a saturated correlation with rotation, with saturation setting in around a ten days rotation period. Above that period, slower rotators show weaker Ca ii activity, as expected. Under that period, the {\textless}i{\textgreater}R'{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}HK{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} index saturates to approximately 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-4{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. Stellar mass modulates the Ca ii activity, with {\textless}i{\textgreater}R'{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}HK{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} showing a constant basal activity above 0.6 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and then decreasing with mass between 0.6 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and the fully-convective limit of 0.35 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. Short-term variability of the activity correlates with its mean level and stars with higher {\textless}i{\textgreater}R'{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}HK{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} indexes show larger {\textless}i{\textgreater}R'{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}HK{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} variability, as previously observed for earlier spectral types.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph has been mounted since 2003 at the ESO 3.6 m telescope in La Silla and provides state-of-the-art stellar radial velocity (RV) measurements with a precision down to ∼1 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. The spectra are extracted with a dedicated data-reduction software (DRS), and the RVs are computed by cross-correlating with a numerical mask.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} This study has three main aims: (i) Create easy access to the public HARPS RV data set. (ii) Apply the new public SpEctrum Radial Velocity AnaLyser (SERVAL) pipeline to the spectra, and produce a more precise RV data set. (iii) Determine whether the precision of the RVs can be further improved by correcting for small nightly systematic effects.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} For each star observed with HARPS, we downloaded the publicly available spectra from the ESO archive and recomputed the RVs with SERVAL. This was based on fitting each observed spectrum with a high signal-to-noise ratio template created by coadding all the available spectra of that star. We then computed nightly zero-points (NZPs) by averaging the RVs of quiet stars.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} By analyzing the RVs of the most RV-quiet stars, whose RV scatter is {\textless} 5 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, we find that SERVAL RVs are on average more precise than DRS RVs by a few percent. By investigating the NZP time series, we find three significant systematic effects whose magnitude is independent of the software that is used to derive the RV: (i) stochastic variations with a magnitude of ∼1 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}; (ii) long-term variations, with a magnitude of ∼1 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and a typical timescale of a few weeks; and (iii) 20–30 NZPs that significantly deviate by a few m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}. In addition, we find small (≲1 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}) but significant intra-night drifts in DRS RVs before the 2015 intervention, and in SERVAL RVs after it. We confirm that the fibre exchange in 2015 caused a discontinuous RV jump that strongly depends on the spectral type of the observed star: from ∼14 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for late F-type stars to ∼ − 3 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} for M dwarfs. The combined effect of extracting the RVs with SERVAL and correcting them for the systematics we find is an improved average RV precision: an improvement of ∼5\% for spectra taken before the 2015 intervention, and an improvement of ∼15\% for spectra taken after it. To demonstrate the quality of the new RV data set, we present an updated orbital solution of the GJ 253 two-planet system.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our NZP-corrected SERVAL RVs can be retrieved from a user-friendly public database. It provides more than 212 000 RVs for about 3000 stars along with much auxiliary information, such as the NZP corrections, various activity indices, and DRS-CCF products.},

This planet has an orbital period P = 38.14 days and a low orbital eccentricity. Our Strömgren b and y photometry of the host star suggests a stellar rotation signature with a period of P = 60 days. The star is somewhat chromospherically active, with a spot filling factor estimated to be several percent. The rotationally induced 60 day signal, however, is well separated from the period of the radial velocity variations, instilling confidence in the interpretation of a Keplerian origin for the observed velocity variations. Although GJ 687 b produces relatively little specific interest in connection with its individual properties, a compelling case can be argued that it is worthy of remark as an eminently typical, yet at a distance of 4.52 pc, a very nearby representative of the galactic planetary census. The detection of GJ 687 b indicates that the APF telescope is well suited to the discovery of low-mass planets orbiting low-mass stars in the as yet relatively un-surveyed region of the sky near the north celestial pole.},

	abstract = {Photospheric stellar activity (i.e. dark spots or bright plages) might be an important source of noise and confusion in stellar radial-velocity (RV) measurements. Radial-velocimetry planet search surveys as well as follow-up of photometric transit surveys require a deeper understanding and characterization of the effects of stellar activities to differentiate them from planetary signals. We simulate dark spots on a rotating stellar photosphere. The variations in the photometry, RV, and spectral line shapes are characterized and analyzed according to the stellar inclination, the latitude, and the number of spots. We show that the anti-correlation between RV and bisector span, known to be a signature of activity, requires a good sampling to be resolved when there are several spots on the photosphere. The Lomb-Scargle periodograms of the RV variations induced by activity present power at the rotational period {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}rot{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} of the star and its two first harmonics {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}rot{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/2 and {\textless}i{\textgreater}P{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}rot{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}/3. Three adjusted sinusoids fixed at the fundamental period and its two-first harmonics allow us to remove about 90\% of the RV jitter amplitude. We apply and validate our approach on four known active planet-host stars: HD 189733, GJ 674, CoRoT-7, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}ι{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Hor. We succeed in fitting simultaneously activity and planetary signals on GJ674 and CoRoT-7. This simultaneous modeling of the activity and planetary parameters leads to slightly higher masses of CoRoT-7b and c of respectively, 5.7 ± 2.5 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Earth{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and 13.2 ± 4.1 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Earth{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}. The larger uncertainties properly take into account the stellar active jitter. We exclude short-period low-mass exoplanets around {\textless}i{\textgreater}ι{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Hor. For data with realistic time-sampling and white Gaussian noise, we use simulations to show that our approach is effective in distinguishing reflex-motion due to a planetary companion and stellar-activity-induced RV variations provided that 1) the planetary orbital period is not close to that of the stellar rotation or one of its two first harmonics; 2) the semi-amplitude of the planet exceeds {\textasciitilde} 30\% of the semi-amplitude of the active signal; 3) the rotational period of the star is accurately known, and 4) the data cover more than one stellar rotational period.},

	abstract = {In this article we present the case of HD 41004 AB, a system composed of a K0V star and a 3.7-mag fainter M-dwarf companion. We have obtained 86 CORALIE spectra of this system with the goal of obtaining precise radial-velocity measurements. Since HD 41004 A and B are separated by only 0.5´´, in every spectrum taken for the radial-velocity measurement, we are observing the blended spectra of the two stars. An analysis of the measurements has revealed a velocity variation with an amplitude of about 50 m s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and a periodicity of 1.3 days. This radial-velocity signal is consistent with the expected variation induced by the presence of a companion to either HD 41004 A or HD 41004 B, or to some other effect due to e.g. activity related phenomena. In particular, such a small velocity amplitude could be the signature of the presence of a very low mass giant planetary companion to HD 41004 A, whose light dominates the spectra. The radial-velocity measurements were then complemented with a photometric campaign and with the analysis of the bisector of the CORALIE Cross-Correlation Function (CCF). While the former revealed no significant variations within the observational precision of {\textasciitilde}0.003–0.004 mag (except for an observed flare event), the bisector analysis showed that the line profiles are varying in phase with the radial-velocity. This latter result, complemented with a series of simulations, has shown that we can explain the observations by considering that HD 41004 B has a brown-dwarf companion orbiting with the observed 1.3-day period. As the spectrum of the fainter HD 41004 B “moves” relative to the one of HD 41004 A (with an amplitude of a few km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}), the relative position of the spectral lines of the two spectra changes, thus changing the blended line-profiles. This variation is large enough to explain the observed radial-velocity and bisector variations, and is compatible with the absence of any photometric signal. If confirmed, this detection represents the first discovery of a brown dwarf in a very short period (1.3-day) orbit around an M dwarf. Finally, this case should be taken as a serious warning about the importance of analyzing the bisector when looking for planets using radial-velocity techniques.},

The host star is among the 10 brightest known to have transiting giant planets, providing opportunities for both planetary atmospheric and asteroseismic studies.},

	abstract = {We present a magnetic activity study of GJ 436 using spectroscopic data from HARPS, spanning over 14 years, and additional data from NARVAL, falling within the HARPS observations. We study the CaII H\&K, HeID3, NaI doublet, Hα and CaII IRT triplets lines and explore linear correlations between them. Using the full HARPS dataset, we found indices Hα versus CaII H\&K \& Hα versus HeI to correlate positively. From the NARVAL dataset, covering one observing epoch, we found CaII IRT3 versus CaII IRT2 \& CaII IRT3 versus Hα index to correlate negatively. We investigate long and short-term periodicity in these index variations using the Generalised Lomb-Scargle periodogram. For CaII H\&K, NaI and Hα indices, we detect long-term periods of 2470.7d ({\textasciitilde} 6.8 years), 1861.6d ({\textasciitilde} 5.1 years) and 2160.9d ({\textasciitilde} 5.9 years) respectively, consistent with GJ 436's photometric cycle of {\textasciitilde} 7.4 years. Applying the 'Pooled Variance' technique to Hα \& NaI indices, we found {\textasciitilde} 2500d to be the period of an activity cycle mechanism, in good agreement with the detected 2470.7d period. For CaII H\&K and Hα indices, we detect short-term periods of \$39.47{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\}\_\{-0.15\}\$d and \$40.46{\textasciicircum}\{+0.44\}\_\{-0.52\}\$d respectively, identified as the stellar rotation period. The stellar rotation is detected after prewhitening the long-term periodicity. It is detected as well in the analysis of individual observing epochs.},

	abstract = {Owing to the ever-present solar wind, our vast solar system is full of plasmas. The turbulent solar wind, together with sporadic solar eruptions, introduces various space plasma processes and phenomena in the solar atmosphere all the way to the Earth's ionosphere and atmosphere and outward to interact with the interstellar media to form the heliopause and termination shock. Remarkable progress has been made in space plasma physics in the last 65 years, mainly due to sophisticated in-situ measurements of plasmas, plasma waves, neutral particles, energetic particles, and dust via space-borne satellite instrumentation. Additionally high technology ground-based instrumentation has led to new and greater knowledge of solar and auroral features. As a result, a new branch of space physics, i.e., space weather, has emerged since many of the space physics processes have a direct or indirect influence on humankind. After briefly reviewing the major space physics discoveries before rockets and satellites, we aim to review all our updated understanding on coronal holes, solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which are central to space weather events at Earth, solar wind, storms and substorms, magnetotail and substorms, emphasizing the role of the magnetotail in substorm dynamics, radiation belts/energetic magnetospheric particles, structures and space weather dynamics in the ionosphere, plasma waves, instabilities, and wave-particle interactions, long-period geomagnetic pulsations, auroras, geomagnetically induced currents (GICs), planetary magnetospheres and solar/stellar wind interactions with comets, moons and asteroids, interplanetary discontinuities, shocks and waves, interplanetary dust, space dusty plasmas and solar energetic particles and shocks, including the heliospheric termination shock. This paper is aimed to provide a panoramic view of space physics and space weather.},

There are 1026 targets with exoplanets observed in the LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectroscopic survey and 158 targets in the medium-resolution spectroscopic survey. We have calculated the equivalent width of the Hα line and determined their stellar activity. The Hα and flare intensities are almost constant for the Rossby number Ro ≤ 0.12 in the saturated regime and decrease with increasing Ro in the unsaturated regime. In addition, we searched the flare events of all stars with exoplanets in the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), Kepler, and K2 surveys. Among the 733 extrasolar planetary systems observed by TESS, we found 481 flares from 57 stars. For Kepler data, we obtained the light curve of 1699 stars and found 1886 flares from 417 stars. For K2 data, we obtained the light curves of 347 stars and found 467 flares from 89 stars. There were light curves of 361 objects with obvious eclipse observed from the TESS survey. We have fitted their light curves with a high signal-to-noise ratio using the JKTEBOP program, and we reobtained the orbital parameters, such as inclination, radius, and period. In the end, we made a judgment on the habitability of exoplanets of stars with flares.},

	abstract = {The Kepler, K2, and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) missions have provided a wealth of confirmed exoplanets, benefiting from a huge effort from the planet-hunting and follow-up community. With careful systematics mitigation, these missions provide precise photometric time series, which enable detection of transiting exoplanet signals. However, exoplanet hunting can be confounded by several factors, including instrumental noise, search biases, and host star variability. In this Letter, we discuss strategies to overcome these challenges using newly emerging techniques and tools. We demonstrate the power of new, fast open-source community tools (e.g., lightkurve, starry, celerite, exoplanet), and discuss four high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) exoplanets that showcase specific challenges present in planet detection: K2-43c, K2-168c, K2-198c, and K2-198d. These planets have been undetected in several large K2 planet searches, despite having transit signals with S/N ≥ 10. Two of the planets discussed here are new discoveries. In this work we confirm all four as true planets. Alongside these planet systems, we discuss three key challenges in finding small transiting exoplanets. The aim of this Letter is to help new researchers understand where planet detection efficiency gains can be made, and to encourage the continued use of K2 archive data. The considerations presented in this Letter are equally applicable to Kepler, K2, and TESS, and the tools discussed here are available for the community to apply to improve exoplanet discovery and fitting.},

We find that TRAPPIST-1 h has a radius of 0.752 R ⊕ and an equilibrium temperature of 173 K.

	abstract = {We have adapted the algorithmic tools developed during the Kepler mission to vet the quality of transit-like signals for use on the K2 mission data. Using the four sets of publicly available light curves at MAST, we produced a uniformly vetted catalog of 772 transiting planet candidates from K2 as listed at the NASA Exoplanet Archive in the K2 Table of Candidates. Our analysis marks 676 of these as planet candidates and 96 as false positives. All confirmed planets pass our vetting tests. Sixty of our false positives are new identifications, effectively doubling the overall number of astrophysical signals mimicking planetary transits in K2 data. Most of the targets listed as false positives in our catalog show either prominent secondary eclipses, transit depths suggesting a stellar companion instead of a planet, or significant photocenter shifts during transit. We packaged our tools into the open-source, automated vetting pipeline Discovery and Vetting of Exoplanets (DAVE), designed to streamline follow-up efforts by reducing the time and resources wasted observing targets that are likely false positives. DAVE will also be a valuable tool for analyzing planet candidates from NASA’s TESS mission, where several guest-investigator programs will provide independent light-curve sets—and likely many more from the community. We are currently testing DAVE on recently released TESS planet candidates and will present our results in a follow-up paper.},

To search for these planets, we analyze all available radial velocity data and apply four signal detection criteria to select the optimal candidates. We find 10 strong candidates satisfying these criteria and three weak candidates showing inconsistency over time due to data samplings. We also confirm three previous planet candidates and improve their orbital solutions through combined analyses of updated data sets. Among the strong planet candidates, HIP 38594 b is a temperate super-Earth with a mass of 8.2 ± 1.7 M ⊕ and an orbital period of 60.7 ± 0.1 days, orbiting around an early-type M dwarf. Early-type M dwarfs are less active and thus are better hosts for habitable planets than mid-type and late-type M dwarfs. Moreover, we report the detection of five two-planet systems, including two systems made up of a warm or cold Neptune and a cold Jupiter, consistent with a positive correlation between these two types of planets. We also detect three temperate Neptunes, four cold Neptunes, and four cold Jupiters, contributing to a rarely explored planet population. Due to their proximity to the Sun, these planets on wide orbits are appropriate targets for direct imaging by future facilities such as the Habitable Exoplanet Observatory and the Extremely Large Telescope.},

Applying Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) to our observations, concentrating in 2015 November and 2016 January and spanning 72 d in total, 16 d in 2015 November and 13 d in 2016 January, we reconstruct surface brightness and magnetic field maps for both epochs and demonstrate that both distributions exhibit temporal evolution not explained by differential rotation alone. We report the detection of a hot Jupiter (hJ) around TAP 26 using three different methods, two using ZDI and one Gaussian-process regression (GPR), with a false-alarm probability smaller than 6 × 10-4. However, as a result of the aliasing related to the observing window, the orbital period cannot be uniquely determined; the orbital period with highest likelihood is 10.79 ± 0.14 d followed by 8.99 ± 0.09 d. Assuming the most likely period, and that the planet orbits in the stellar equatorial plane, we obtain that the planet has a minimum mass Msin I of 1.66 ± 0.31 MJup and orbits at 0.0968 ± 0.0032 au from its host star. This new detection suggests that disc type II migration is efficient at generating newborn hJs, and that hJs may be more frequent around young T Tauri stars than around mature stars (or that the MaTYSSE sample is biased towards hJ-hosting stars).},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The nearby ultra-compact multiplanetary system YZ Ceti consists of at least three planets, and a fourth tentative signal. The orbital period of each planet is the subject of discussion in the literature due to strong aliasing in the radial velocity data. The stellar activity of this M dwarf also hampers significantly the derivation of the planetary parameters.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} With an additional 229 radial velocity measurements obtained since the discovery publication, we reanalyze the YZ Ceti system and resolve the alias issues.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We use model comparison in the framework of Bayesian statistics and periodogram simulations based on a method by Dawson and Fabrycky to resolve the aliases. We discuss additional signals in the RV data, and derive the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the stellar activity with a Gaussian process regression model. To constrain the planetary parameters further we apply a stability analysis on our ensemble of Keplerian fits.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We find no evidence for a fourth possible companion. We resolve the aliases: the three planets orbit the star with periods of 2.02 d, 3.06 d, and 4.66 d. We also investigate an effect of the stellar rotational signal on the derivation of the planetary parameters, in particular the eccentricity of the innermost planet. Using photometry we determine the stellar rotational period to be close to 68 d and we also detect this signal in the residuals of a three-planet fit to the RV data and the spectral activity indicators. From our stability analysis we derive a lower limit on the inclination of the system with the assumption of coplanar orbits which is {\textless}i{\textgreater}i{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}min{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 0.9 deg. From the absence of a transit event with TESS, we derive an upper limit of the inclination of {\textless}i{\textgreater}i{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} = 87.43 deg.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} YZ Ceti is a prime example of a system where strong aliasing hindered the determination of the orbital periods of exoplanets. Additionally, stellar activity influences the derivation of planetary parameters and modeling them correctly is important for the reliable estimation of the orbital parameters in this specific compact system. Stability considerations then allow additional constraints to be placed on the planetary parameters.},

Proxima Centauri b has a minimum mass of 1.3 Earth masses and orbits with a period of 11.2 days at 0.05 AU from its stellar host, and resides within the star's Habitable Zone. While recent work has shown that Proxima Centauri b likely does not transit, given the value of potential atmospheric observations via transmission spectroscopy of the closest possible Habitable Zone planet, we reevaluate the possibility that Proxima Centauri b is a transiting exoplanet using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We use three sectors (Sectors 11, 12, and 38 at 2-minute cadence) of observations from TESS to search for planets. Proxima Centauri is an extremely active M5.5 star, emitting frequent white-light flares; we employ a novel method that includes modeling the stellar activity in our planet search algorithm. We do not detect any planet signals. We injected synthetic transiting planets into the TESS and use this analysis to show that Proxima Centauri b cannot be a transiting exoplanet with a radius larger than 0.4 R\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$. Moreover, we show that it is unlikely that any Habitable Zone planets larger than Mars transit Proxima Centauri.},

	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for precision radial velocity (pRV) measurements, a line-by-line (LBL) approach designed to handle outlying spectral information in a simple but efficient manner. The effectiveness of the LBL method is demonstrated on two data sets, one obtained with SPIRou on Barnard's star, and the other with the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) on Proxima Centauri. In the near-infrared, the LBL provides a framework for meters-per-second-level accuracy in pRV measurements despite the challenges associated with telluric absorption and sky emission lines. We confirm with SPIRou measurements spanning 2.7 yr that the candidate super-Earth on a 233 day orbit around Barnard's star is an artifact due to a combination of time sampling and activity. The LBL analysis of the Proxima Centauri HARPS post-upgrade data alone easily recovers the Proxima b signal and also provides a 2σ detection of the recently confirmed 5 day Proxima d planet, but argues against the presence of the candidate Proxima c with a period of 1900 days. We provide evidence that the Proxima c signal is associated with small, unaccounted systematic effects affecting the HARPS-TERRA template-matching radial velocity extraction method for long-period signals. Finally, the LBL framework provides a very effective activity indicator, akin to the FWHM derived from the cross-correlation function, from which we infer a rotation period of \$\{92.1\}\_\{-3.5\}{\textasciicircum}\{+4.2\}\$ days for Proxima.},

Previous claims of possible transits from optical ground- and space-based photometry were likely correlated noise in the data from Proxima Centauri’s frequent flaring. Our study indicates dramatically reduced stellar activity at near-to-mid infrared wavelengths, compared to the optical.

We adopt vertical distance {\textbar}Z{\textbar} from the Galactic disc as a proxy for age and confirm a strong trend of flaring fraction decreasing with growing stellar age. Among M dwarfs within 50 pc of the Sun, we find a flaring fraction of one in 1500, independent of spectral type from M2 to M7, suggesting that these stars are all in a flare-saturated young evolutionary stage. We find a hint of a kink in the slope of the overall flare fraction near 100 pc from the plane, where a steep decline begins; this slope change is visible for mid-type M dwarfs (M3-M5), suggesting it is not an artefact of mixing spectral type. Together with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Hα emission, this trend is additional evidence that the activity fraction of M dwarfs depends on Galactic height and activity lifetime. While there is a hint of flattening of the overall activity fraction above {\textbar}Z{\textbar} ≍ 500 pc, our data do not constrain this further.

The X28 flare is the largest flare since GOES began its solar X-ray measurements in 1976. The solar (full-disk) irradiance during these flares was observed by the instruments aboard the NASA Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) spacecraft and the NASA Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, Energetics, and Dynamics (TIMED) spacecraft. The total solar irradiance (TSI) dropped by unprecedented 0.34\% during this period due to the dark, large sunspots. In addition, the TSI increased by 270 ppm during the X17 (4B optical) flare on 28 October, the first definitive measurement of a TSI flare event. The ultraviolet (UV) variations for this X17 flare range from a factor of about 50 shortward of 10 nm to about 10\% for the Mg II 280 nm emission. One interesting result for the UV flare variations is that the broad wings of the H I Lyman-α (121.6 nm) emission increased by more than a factor of 2 during the X17 flare while the core of the Lyman-α emission only increased by 20\%. Another interesting result is the time profile of the Si III 120.6 nm emission, which shows a sharp 1-minute long increase by a factor of 17 during the impulsive phase.},

In these flares elemental abundances found to be enhanced by factors of ∼1.3-1.5 to the quiescent states.

The energies released in the X-ray and Hα emissions during the flares were 1036-1038 and 1035-1037 erg, respectively. This renders the set of the observations as the first successful simultaneous X-ray/Hα observations of the stellar flares with energies above 1035 erg; although the coverage of the Hα observations was limited, with \${\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}! 10{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the e-folding time in the decay phase of the flares, that of the SXR ones was complete. Combining the obtained physical parameters and those in literature for solar and stellar flares, we obtained a good proportional relation between the emitted energies of X-ray and Hα emissions for a flare energy range of 1029-1038 erg. The ratio of the Hα-line to bolometric X-ray emissions was {\textasciitilde}0.1, where the latter was estimated by converting the observed SXR emission to that in the 0.1-100 keV band according to the best-fitting thin thermal model. We also found that the e-folding times of the SXR and Hα light curves in the decaying phase of a flare are in agreement for a time range of 1-104 s. Even very large stellar flares with energies of six orders of magnitude larger than the most energetic solar flares follow the same scaling relationships with solar and much less energetic stellar flares. This fact suggests that their physical parameters can be estimated on the basis of the known physics of solar and stellar flares.},

Furthermore, the computation of the well-known density-sensitive line ratio C iii({\textless}i{\textgreater}λ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}1176 Å)/C iii({\textless}i{\textgreater}λ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}977 Å) is also possible, and allows the investigation of its dependence on stellar activity.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Three late-type main-sequence stars found in the FUSE archive (HD 36705, HD 197481, and Gl 388) show flares in their light curves. We find no obvious Doppler shifts in the brightest lines of these stars, but the O vi({\textless}i{\textgreater}λ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}1032 Å) transition region line of AD Leo shows a blue wing enhancement one spectrum after a flare event. This emission feature is shifted by {\textasciitilde}–84 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} from the line core. We can exclude that the spectral feature was caused by a gas cloud co-rotating with the star and favor an interpretation of a mass ejection. In addition we find an increase of the C iii({\textless}i{\textgreater}λ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}1176 Å)/C iii({\textless}i{\textgreater}λ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}977 Å) line ratio during all detected flares. We compare this finding to the Sun using solar full-disk spectra from the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) and SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) missions, and find that powerful flare events also show an increased C iii({\textless}i{\textgreater}λ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}1176 Å)/C iii({\textless}i{\textgreater}λ{\textless}i/{\textgreater}977 Å) line ratio but this result is of low statistical significance. Owing to a lack of perfectly temporally coinciding TIMED/SORCE spectra and a low temporal resolution ({\textasciitilde}15 spectra per day) it is not possible to distinguish clearly if this increase is caused by the flares or by the related mass ejections.},

At a distance of 6.9 pc, it is the second nearest transiting exoplanet system found to date, and the closest one known for which the primary is an M dwarf. The host stellar system consists of three mid-to-late M dwarfs in a hierarchical configuration, which are blended in one TESS pixel. We use MEarth data and results from the Science Processing Operations Center data validation report to determine that the planet transits the primary star in the system. The planet has a radius of \{1.38\}-0.12+0.13 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus , an orbital period of \{5.35882\}-0.00031+0.00030 days, and an equilibrium temperature of \{433\}-27+28 K. With radial velocities from the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher, we place a 3σ upper mass limit of 8.4 \{M\}{\textbackslash}oplus on the planet. LTT 1445Ab provides one of the best opportunities to date for the spectroscopic study of the atmosphere of a terrestrial world. We also present a detailed characterization of the host stellar system. We use high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging to rule out the presence of any other close stellar or brown dwarf companions. Nineteen years of photometric monitoring of A and BC indicate a moderate amount of variability, in agreement with that observed in the TESS light-curve data. We derive a preliminary astrometric orbit for the BC pair that reveals an edge-on and eccentric configuration. The presence of a transiting planet in this system hints that the entire system may be co-planar, implying that the system may have formed from the early fragmentation of an individual protostellar core.},

Our results show for the first time that nitrate concentrations in an ice core can be used as a proxy for past solar activity on decadal to multidecadal time scales. Furthermore, 11-year and 22-year periodicities were detected in nitrate variations even during the Maunder Minimum (1645-1715), when sunspots were almost absent. This discovery may support cyclic behavior of the solar dynamo during the grand solar minimum.},

Here, we focus on the instantaneous magnetic forces on an orbiting body in the limit where the dipole approximation describes its magnetic properties as well as those of its stellar host. A permanent magnet in orbit about a star will be inexorably drawn toward the stellar host if the magnetic force is comparable to gravity due to the steep radial dependence of the dipole-dipole interaction. While magnetic fields in observed systems are much too weak to drive a merger event, we confirm that they may be high enough in some close compact binaries to cause measurable orbital precession. When the orbiting body is a conductor, the stellar field induces a time-varying magnetic dipole moment that leads to the possibility of eccentricity pumping and resonance trapping. The challenge is that the orbiter must be close to the stellar host, so that magnetic interactions must compete with tidal forces and the effects of intense stellar radiation.},

Several attempts have been made by the present authors to isolate the oscillatory properties expected on this main-sequence star, but we did not find any presence of solar-like pulsations. The suppression of the amplitude of the acoustic modes can be explained by the high level of magnetic activity revealed for this target, not only by the study of the photometric light-curve, but also by the analysis of three decades available of Mount Wilson spectroscopic data. In particular, our measurements of the stellar rotational period Prot=3.4 d and of the main principal magnetic cycle of 12 a confirm previous findings and allow us to locate this star in the early main sequence phase of its evolution during which the chromospheric activity is dominated by the superposition of several cycles before the transition to the phase of the magnetic-braking shutdown with the subsequent decrease of the magnetic activity.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The study of stellar activity is important because it can provide new constraints for dynamo models when combined with surface rotation rates and the depth of the convection zone. We know that the dynamo mechanism, which is believed to be the main process that rules the magnetic cycle of solar-like stars, results from the interaction between (differential) rotation, convection, and magnetic field. The {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler {\textless}i/{\textgreater}mission has already been collecting data for a large number of stars during four years allowing us to investigate magnetic stellar cycles.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We investigated the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler {\textless}i/{\textgreater}light curves to look for magnetic activity or even hints of magnetic activity cycles. Based on the photometric data we also looked for new magnetic indexes to characterise the magnetic activity of the stars.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We selected a sample of 22 solar-like F stars that have a rotation period shorter than 12 days. We performed a time-frequency analysis using the Morlet wavelet yielding a magnetic proxy for our sample of stars. We computed the magnetic index {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}ph{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} as the standard deviation of the whole time series and the index ⟨ {\textless}i{\textgreater}S{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}ph{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ⟩, which is the mean of standard deviations measured in subseries of length five times the rotation period of the star. We defined new indicators, such as the contrast between high and low activity, to take into account the fact that complete magnetic cycles are not observed for all the stars. We also inferred the Rossby number of the stars and studied their stellar background.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}This analysis shows different types of behaviour in the 22 F stars. Two stars show behaviour very similar to magnetic activity cycles. Five stars show long-lived spots or active regions suggesting the existence of active longitudes. Two stars in our sample seem to have a decreasing or increasing trend in the temporal variation of the magnetic proxies. Finally, the last group of stars shows magnetic activity (with the presence of spots) but no sign of cycle.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present the first magnetic images of the rapidly rotating young K0 dwarf AB Doradus. Simultaneous brightness images are also reconstructed. These images are obtained from two independent data sets recorded four to six nights (eight to twelve rotation cycles) apart, with the UCL Echelle Spectrograph of the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1995 December. All images are recovered from sets of `average profiles' obtained through a least-squares deconvolution process of about 1500 lines throughout the whole visible spectrum. We find that about 20 per cent of the surface of AB Dor is covered with a significant ({\textgreater}200G) field, whose flux within these magnetic regions is typically 500 G, with peaks up to 1.5 kG. The associated magnetic field topology is essentially radial (in 1995 December) and features an alternating east-west polarity structure at intermediate to high latitudes, comprising up to 12 regions of opposite polarities. We suspect that this pattern represents the emergence of buoyant flux tubes from an underlying toroidal field structure. The toroidal field itself is also detected at the photospheric level, and switches from positive polarity at intermediate latitudes to negative polarity in circumpolar regions. Altogether, it suggests that the associated dynamo is probably not purely solar-like (i.e. confined to an overshoot layer at the base of the convective zone), but must also feature a significant component distributed throughout the whole convective envelope. From the evolution of brightness maps throughout eight rotations, we infer that the pole of AB Dor rotates more slowly than the equator, by about one part in 220. The corresponding `lap time' required for the equatorial region to lap the pole is thus of the order of 110d, very close to the solar value of 120d. Along with the information that the photometric period has been in steady decrease since 1988, our result implies that cool features have moved equatorward on average on AB Dor. Repeated observations of the Hα-absorbing circumstellar prominence system indicate rotation periods for individual prominences that are significantly longer than those obtained for the mid-latitude magnetic features. We infer that if the prominences corotate with the footpoints of the magnetic structures in which they form, they must be anchored at latitudes greater than 60 deg.},

	abstract = {Exoplanet surveys around M dwarfs have detected a growing number of exoplanets with Earth-like insolation. It is expected that some of those planets are rocky planets with the potential for temperate climates favourable to surface liquid water. However, various models predict that terrestrial planets orbiting in the classical habitable zone around M dwarfs have no water or too much water, suggesting that habitable planets around M dwarfs might be rare. Here we present the results of an updated planetary population synthesis model, which includes the effects of water enrichment in the primordial atmosphere, caused by the oxidation of atmospheric hydrogen by rocky materials from incoming planetesimals and from the magma ocean. We find that this water production in the primordial atmosphere is found to significantly impact the occurrence of terrestrial rocky aqua planets, yielding ones with diverse water content. We estimate that 5-10\% of the planets with a size of {\textless}1.3R⊕ orbiting early-to-mid M dwarfs have appropriate amounts of seawater for habitability. Such an occurrence rate would be high enough to detect potentially habitable planets by ongoing and near-future M-dwarf planet survey missions.},

The transiting planet HD 189733b is one of the very hot Jupiters with shortest periods and, thus, smallest orbits, which makes them ideal candidates for polarimetric detections. We obtained polarimetric measurements of HD 189733 in the B band well distributed over the orbital period and detected two polarization maxima near planetary elongations with a peak amplitude of {\textasciitilde}2 × 10-4. Assuming Rayleigh scattering, we estimated the effective size of the scattering atmosphere (Lambert sphere) to be 1.5 ± 0.2 RJ, which is 30\% larger than the radius of the opaque body previously inferred from transits. If the scattering matter fills the planetary Roche lobe, the lower limit of the geometrical albedo can be estimated as 0.14. The phase dependence of polarization indicates that the planetary orbit is oriented almost in a north-south direction with a longitude of ascending node Ω = (16° or 196°) ± 8°. We obtain independent estimates of the orbit inclination i = 98° ± 8° and eccentricity e = 0.0 (with an uncertainty of 0.05), which are in excellent agreement with values determined previously from transits and radial velocities. Our findings clearly demonstrate the power of polarimetry and open a new dimension in exploring exoplanetary atmospheres even for systems without transits.},

They have been observed in most planets and some moons of the solar system. Since their first discovery in 2005, Mars auroras have been studied extensively and is now a rapidly growing area of research. Since Mars lacks an intrinsic global magnetic field, its crustal field is distributed throughout the planet and its interactions with the surrounding plasma environment lead to a number of complex processes resulting in several types of auroras uncommon on Earth. Martian auroras have been classified as diffuse, discrete and proton aurora. With new capability of synoptic observations made possible with the Hope probe, two new types of auroras have been observed. One of them, which occurs on a much larger spatial scale, covering much of the disk, is known as discrete sinuous aurora. The other subcategory is one of proton auroras observed in patches. Further study of these phenomena will provide insights into the interactions between the atmosphere, magnetosphere and the surrounding plasma environment of Mars. We provide a brief review of the work done on the subject in the past 17 years since their discovery, and report new developments based on observations with Hope probe.},

Past ultraviolet Hubble Space Telescope observations, supported by hydrodynamic models, confirmed that these factors lead to the formation of an extended envelope, part of which lies beyond the Roche lobe. We use gas-dynamic simulations to study the impact of time variations in the parameters of the stellar wind, namely that of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), on the envelope of the typical hot-Jupiter HD 209458b. We consider three CMEs characterized by different velocities and densities, taking their parameters from typical CMEs observed for the Sun. The perturbations in the ram-pressure of the stellar wind during the passage of each CME tear off most of the envelope that is located beyond the Roche lobe. This leads to a substantial increase of the mass-loss rates during the interaction with the CME. We find that the mass lost by the planet during the whole crossing of a CME is of ≈1015 g, regardless of the CME taken into consideration. We also find that over the course of 1 Gyr, the mass lost by the planet because of CME impacts is comparable to that lost because of high-energy stellar irradiation.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric erosion of CO2 -rich Earth-size exoplanets due to coronal mass ejection (CME)-induced ion pick up within close-in habitable zones of active M-type dwarf stars is investigated. Since M stars are active at the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation (XUV) wave-lengths over long periods of time, we have applied a thermal balance model at various XUV flux input values for simulating the thermospheric heating by photodissociation and ionization processes due to exothermic chemical reactions and cooling by the CO2 infrared radiation in the 15 μm band. Our study shows that intense XUV radiation of active M stars results in atmospheric expansion and extended exospheres. Using thermospheric neutral and ion densities calculated for various XUV fluxes, we applied a numerical test particle model for simulation of atmospheric ion pick up loss from an extended exosphere arising from its interaction with expected minimum and maximum CME plasma flows. Our results indicate that the Earth-like exoplanets that have no, or weak, magnetic moments may lose tens to hundreds of bars of atmospheric pressure, or even their whole atmospheres due to the CME-induced O ion pick up at orbital distances ≤0.2 astronomical units. We have found that, when exposed to intense XUV fluxes, atmospheres with CO2 /N2 mixing ratios lower than 96\% will show an increase in exospheric temperatures and expanded thermosphere–exosphere environments. Hence, they suffer stronger atmospheric erosion, which can result in the total loss of several hundred bars even if an exoplanet is protected by a “magnetic shield” with its boundary located at 1 Earth radius above the surface. Furthermore, our study indicates that magnetic moments of tidally locked Earth-like exoplanets are essential for protecting their expanded upper atmospheres because of intense XUV radiation against CME plasma erosion. Therefore, we suggest that larger and more massive terrestrial-type exoplanets may better protect their atmospheres against CMEs, because the larger cores of such exoplanets would generate stronger magnetic moments and their higher gravitational acceleration would constrain the expansion of their thermosphere-exosphere regions and reduce atmospheric escape.

With this radius, we estimate the atmospheric surface that is not protected from stellar winds. We have analyzed this unprotected surface for the most extreme environment for exoplanets: GKM-type and very low-mass stars at the two limits of the habitable zone. The estimated unprotected surface makes it possible to define a likelihood for an exoplanet to retain its atmosphere. This function can be incorporated into the new habitability index SEPHI.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Using different formulations in the literature in addition to stellar and exoplanet physical characteristics, we estimated the stellar magnetic induction, the main characteristics of the stellar wind, and the different star-planet interaction regions (sub- and super-Alfvénic, sub- and supersonic). With this information, we can estimate the radius of the exoplanet magnetopause and thus the exoplanet unprotected surface.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We have conducted a study of the auroral aperture angles for Earth-like exoplanets orbiting the habitable zone of its star, and found different behaviors depending on whether the star is in rotational saturated or unsaturated regimes, with angles of aperture of the auroral ring above or below 36°, respectively, and with different slopes for the linear relation between the auroral aperture angle at the inner edge of the habitable zone versus the difference between auroral aperture angles at the two boundaries of the habitable zone. When the planet is tidally locked, the unprotected angle increases dramatically to values higher than 40° with a low likelihood of keeping its atmosphere. When the impact of stellar wind is produced in the sub-Alfvénic regime, the likelihood of keeping the atmosphere is almost zero for exoplanets orbiting very close to their star, regardless of whether they are saturated or not.},

The James Webb Space Telescope is expected to characterize the atmospheres of these planets, potentially detecting CO2, CO, H2O, CH4, or abiotic O2 from water photodissociation and subsequent hydrogen escape. Here, we apply a coupled atmosphere-interior evolution model to the Trappist-1 planets to anticipate their modern atmospheres. This model, which has previously been validated for Earth and Venus, connects magma ocean crystallization to temperate geochemical cycling. Mantle convection, magmatic outgassing, atmospheric escape, crustal oxidation, a radiative-convective climate model, and deep volatile cycling are explicitly coupled to anticipate bulk atmospheres and planetary redox evolution over 8 Gyr. By adopting a Monte Carlo approach that samples a broad range of initial conditions and unknown parameters, we make some tentative predictions about current Trappist-1 atmospheres. We find that anoxic atmospheres are probable, but not guaranteed, for the outer planets; oxygen produced via hydrogen loss during the pre-main sequence is typically consumed by crustal sinks. In contrast, oxygen accumulation on the inner planets occurs in around half of all models runs. Complete atmospheric erosion is possible but not assured for the inner planets (occurs in 20\%-50\% of model runs), whereas the outer planets retain significant surface volatiles in virtually all model simulations. For all planets that retain substantial atmospheres, CO2-dominated or CO2-O2 atmospheres are expected; water vapor is unlikely to be a detectable atmospheric constituent in most cases. There are necessarily many caveats to these predictions, but the ways in which they misalign with upcoming observations will highlight gaps in terrestrial planet knowledge.},

This wavelength range can warm and ionize terrestrial planets' upper atmospheres, which expands the planetary radius and promotes atmospheric loss. In this work, we study the contribution of the XUV flux due to flares on the atmospheric escape of Earth-like planets orbiting M dwarfs through numerical simulations. We considered the first Gyr of planets with initial surface water abundances between 1 and 10 terrestrial oceans (TO), a small primordial hydrogen envelope (≤10-3 M ⊕), and with host-star masses between 0.2 and 0.6 M ⊙. In this parameter range, we find that flares can remove up to two TO more than nonflaring stars, which, in some cases, translates to a doubling of the total water loss. We also find that flaring can increase atmospheric oxygen partial pressures by hundreds of bars in some cases. These results were obtained by adding a new module for flares to the VPLanet software package and upgrading its atmospheric escape module to account for Roche lobe overflow and radiation/recombination-limited escape.},

We find that stellar flares increase the amount of ozone in the atmosphere by a factor of 20 compared to a quiescent star. We find that coronal mass ejections abiotically generate significant levels of potential bio-signatures such as N2O. The changes in atmospheric composition cause a moderate decrease in the amount of ultraviolet light that reaches the planets surface, suggesting that while flares are potentially harmful to life, the changes in the atmosphere due to a stellar flare act to reduce the impact of the next stellar flare.},

One particular source of false positives is the presence of stellar magnetic or chromospheric activity that can mimic the radial velocity reflex motion of a planet. Here we present the results of a photometric data analysis for the known planet-hosting star BD -06°1339, observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite during Sector 6 at a cadence of 2 minutes. We discuss evidence that suggests that the observed 3.9-day periodic radial velocity signature may be caused by stellar activity rather than a planetary companion, since variability detected in the photometric data is consistent with the periodic signal. We conclude that the previously reported planetary signature is likely the result of a false-positive signal resulting from stellar activity, and we discuss the need for more data to confirm this conclusion.},

The thousands of exoplanets discovered over the past decade have most recently been supplemented by discoveries of potentially habitable planets around nearby low-mass stars. Currently, the field is rapidly progressing towards detailed spectroscopic observations to characterise the atmospheres of these planets. While various surveys from space and ground are expected to detect numerous more exoplanets orbiting nearby stars, the imminent launch of JWST along with large ground-based facilities are expected to revolutionise exoplanetary spectroscopy. Such observations, combined with detailed theoretical models and inverse methods, provide valuable insights into a wide range of physical processes and chemical compositions in exoplanetary atmospheres. Depending on the planetary properties, the knowledge of atmospheric compositions can also place important constraints on planetary formation and migration mechanisms, geophysical processes, and, ultimately, biosignatures. In the present review, we will discuss the modern and future landscape of this frontier area of exoplanetary atmospheres. We will start with a brief review of the area, emphasising the key insights gained from different observational methods and theoretical studies. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of the state-of-the-art, challenges, and future prospects in three forefront branches of the area.},

Unexplained rapid bursts from the binary system TV Columbae, in which mass is accreted onto a moderately strong magnetized white dwarf from a low-mass companion, have been observed on several occasions in the past 40 years7-11. During these bursts, the optical/ultraviolet luminosity increases by a factor of more than three in less than an hour and fades in around ten hours. Fast outflows have been observed in ultraviolet spectral lines7, with velocities of more than 3,500 kilometres per second, comparable to the escape velocity from the white dwarf surface. Here we report on optical bursts observed in TV Columbae and in two additional accreting systems, EI Ursae Majoris and ASASSN-19bh. The bursts have a total energy of approximately 10−6 times than those of classical nova explosions (micronovae) and bear a strong resemblance to type-I X-ray bursts12-14.

However, dense star-forming regions also tend to be populous, containing massive stars that emit photoionizing radiation, which can evaporate the gas in protoplanetary discs. We analyse N-body simulations of star-forming regions containing Jovian-mass planets and determine the times when their orbits are altered, when they become free-floating, and when they are stolen or captured. Simultaneously, we perform calculations of the evolution of protoplanetary discs when exposed to FUV radiation fields from massive stars in the same star-forming regions. In almost half (44 per cent) of the planetary systems that are disrupted - either altered, captured, stolen or become free-floating, we find that the radius of the protoplanetary disc evolves inwards, or the gas in the disc is completely evaporated, before the planets' orbits are disrupted. This implies that planets that are disrupted in dense, populous star-forming regions are more likely to be super-Earths or mini-Neptunes, as Jovian mass planets would not be able to form due to mass-loss from photoevaporation. Furthermore, the recent discoveries of distant Jovian mass planets around tightly packed terrestrial planets argue against their formation in populous star-forming regions, as photoevaporation would preclude gas giant planet formation at distances of more than a few au.},

	abstract = {The Sun is the only star whose surface can be directly resolved at high resolution, and therefore constitutes an excellent test case to explore the physical origin of stellar radial-velocity (RV) variability. We present HARPS observations of sunlight scattered off the bright asteroid 4/Vesta, from which we deduced the Sun's activity-driven RV variations. In parallel, the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory provided us with simultaneous high spatial resolution magnetograms, Dopplergrams and continuum images of the Sun in the Fe I 6173 Å line. We determine the RV modulation arising from the suppression of granular blueshift in magnetized regions and the flux imbalance induced by dark spots and bright faculae. The rms velocity amplitudes of these contributions are 2.40 and 0.41 m s-1, respectively, which confirms that the inhibition of convection is the dominant source of activity-induced RV variations at play, in accordance with previous studies. We find the Doppler imbalances of spot and plage regions to be only weakly anticorrelated. Light curves can thus only give incomplete predictions of convective blueshift suppression. We must instead seek proxies that track the plage coverage on the visible stellar hemisphere directly. The chromospheric flux index R{\textasciicircum}' \vphantom{\{}\}\_\{HK\} derived from the HARPS spectra performs poorly in this respect, possibly because of the differences in limb brightening/darkening in the chromosphere and photosphere. We also find that the activity-driven RV variations of the Sun are strongly correlated with its full-disc magnetic flux density, which may become a useful proxy for activity-related RV noise.},

Although RV and are often well correlated, a combination of geometrical effects (butterfly diagrams related to dynamo processes and inclination) and activity level variations over time create an hysteresis pattern during the cycle, which produces a departure from an excellent correlation: for a given activity level, the RV is higher or lower during the ascending phase compared to the descending phase of the cycle depending on inclination, with a reversal for inclinations about 60° from pole-on. We find that this hysteresis is also observed for the Sun, as well as for other stars. This property is due to the spatio-temporal distribution of the activity pattern (and therefore to the dynamo processes) and to the difference in projection effects of the RV and chromospheric emission.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} These results allow us to propose a new method which significantly improves the correction for long timescales (fraction of the cycle), and could be crucial to improving detection rates of planets in the habitable zone around F6-K4 stars.},

Astrometry is in principle less sensitive to stellar activity because the situation is more favourable: the stellar astrometric signal is expected to be fainter than the planetary astrometric signal compared to radial velocities.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We quantify the effect of stellar activity on high-precision astrometry when Earth-mass planets are searched for in the habitable zone around old main-sequence solar-type stars.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We used a very large set of magnetic activity synthetic time series to characterise the properties of the stellar astrometric signal. We then studied the detectability of exoplanets based on different approaches: first based on the theoretical level of false positives derived from the synthetic time series, and then with blind tests for old main-sequence F6-K4 stars.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The amplitude of the signal can be up to a few times the solar value depending on the assumptions made for activity level, spectral type, and spot contrast. The detection rates for 1 {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}Earth{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} planets are very good, however, with extremely low false-positive rates in the habitable zone for stars in the F6-K4 range at 10 pc. The standard false-alarm probability using classical bootstrapping on the time series strongly overestimates the false-positive level. This affects the detection rates.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We conclude that if technological challenges can be overcome and very high precision is reached, astrometry is much more suitable for detecting Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone around nearby solar-type stars than radial velocity, and detection rates are much higher for this range of planetary masses and periods when astrometric techniques are used than with radial velocity techniques.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220913903V},
	abstract = {Over the past years, thousands of stellar flares have been detected by harvesting data from large photometric surveys. These detections, however, do not account for potential sources of contamination such as background stars appearing in the same aperture as the primary target. We present a new method for identifying the true flare sources in large photometric surveys using data from the Kepler mission. Potential flares are identified in two steps: first, we search the light curves for at least two subsequent data points exceeding a 5\{{\textbackslash}sigma\} threshold above the running mean. For these two cadences, we subtract the "quiet" stellar flux from the Kepler pixel data to obtain new images where the potential flare is the main light source. In the second step, we use a Bayesian approach to fit the point spread function of the instrument to determine the most likely location of the flux excess on the detector. We applied our method to 5862 main-sequence stars with near-solar effective temperatures. We found 2274 events exceeding the 5-sigma in at least two consecutive points in the light curves. Applying the second step reduced this number to 342 superflares. Of these, 283 flares happened on 178 target stars, 47 events are associated with fainter background stars, and in 10 cases, the flare location cannot be distinguished between the target and a background star. We also present cases where flares have been reported previously but our technique could not attribute them to the target star. We conclude that 1) identifying outliers in the light curves alone is insufficient to attribute them to stellar flares and 2) flares can only be uniquely attributed to a certain star when the instrument pixel-level data together with the point spread function are taken into account. As a consequence, previous flare statistics are likely contaminated by instrumental effects and unresolved astrophysical sources.},

We used the Blue and Red channels obtained by the 27 cm telescope of the CoRoT satellite at high cadence and long duration. The wavelength limits of the channels were estimated using spectra from the Pickles library for the spectral type and luminosity class of each star, provided by the Exodat Database. The temperatures were obtained from the flare energy Blue-to-Red ratio, using the flare equivalent duration and stellar flux in both channels. The expected value of the analyzed flares is equal to 6400 K with a standard deviation of 2800 K, where the mean stellar spectral type, weighted by the number of flares in each spectral subclass, is equal to G6. Contrary to our results, a stellar white-light flare is often assumed to emit as a blackbody with a temperature of 9000 or 10,000 K. Our estimates agree, however, with values obtained for solar flares. The GAIA G-band transmissivity is comparable to that of the CoRoT White channel, which allows us to calibrate the flares to the Gaia photometric system. The energy in the G band of the analyzed flares varies between 1032 and 1037 erg, and the flare area ranges from 30 μsh to 3 sh (solar hemisphere). The energy release per area in a flare is proportional to \$\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{flare\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{2.6\}\$ , at least up to 10,000 K.},

Most of the superflare stars show quasi-periodic brightness modulations with a typical period of one to a few tens of days. Our results indicate that these brightness variations can be explained by the rotation of a star with fairly large starspots. Using the results of the period analysis, we investigated the relation between the energy and frequency of superflares and the rotation period. Stars with relatively slower rotation rates can still produce flares that are as energetic as those of more rapidly rotating stars although the average flare frequency is lower for more slowly rotating stars. We found that the energy of superflares is related to the total coverage of the starspot. The correlation between the spot coverage and the flare energy in superflares is similar to that in solar flares. These results suggest that the energy of superflares can be explained by the magnetic energy stored around the starspots.},

	abstract = {Starspots are created by local magnetic fields on the surfaces of stars, just as sunspots. Their fields are strong enough to suppress the overturning convective motion and thus block or redirect the flow of energy from the stellar interior outwards to the surface and consequently appear as locally cool and therefore dark regions against an otherwise bright photosphere (Biermann in Astronomische Nachrichten 264:361, 1938; Z Astrophysik 25:135, 1948). As such, starspots are observable tracers of the yet unknown internal dynamo activity and allow a glimpse into the complex internal stellar magnetic field structure. Starspots also enable the precise measurement of stellar rotation which is among the key ingredients for the expected internal magnetic topology. But whether starspots are just blown-up sunspot analogs, we do not know yet. This article is an attempt to review our current knowledge of starspots. A comparison of a white-light image of the Sun (G2V, 5 Gyr) with a Doppler image of a young solar-like star (EK Draconis; G1.5V, age 100 Myr, rotation 10 × ΩSun) and with a mean-field dynamo simulation suggests that starspots can be of significantly different appearance and cannot be explained with a scaling of the solar model, even for a star of same mass and effective temperature. Starspots, their surface location and migration pattern, and their link with the stellar dynamo and its internal energy transport, may have far reaching impact also for our understanding of low-mass stellar evolution and formation. Emphasis is given in this review to their importance as activity tracers in particular in the light of more and more precise exoplanet detections around solar-like, and therefore likely spotted, host stars.},

	abstract = {This work reviews the long-term evolution of the atmosphere of Venus, and modulation of its composition by interior/exterior cycling. The formation and evolution of Venus's atmosphere, leading to contemporary surface conditions, remain hotly debated topics, and involve questions that tie into many disciplines. We explore these various inter-related mechanisms which shaped the evolution of the atmosphere, starting with the volatile sources and sinks. Going from the deep interior to the top of the atmosphere, we describe volcanic outgassing, surface-atmosphere interactions, and atmosphere escape. Furthermore, we address more complex aspects of the history of Venus, including the role of Late Accretion impacts, how magnetic field generation is tied into long-term evolution, and the implications of geochemical and geodynamical feedback cycles for atmospheric evolution. We highlight plausible end-member evolutionary pathways that Venus could have followed, from accretion to its present-day state, based on modeling and observations. In a first scenario, the planet was desiccated by atmospheric escape during the magma ocean phase. In a second scenario, Venus could have harbored surface liquid water for long periods of time, until its temperate climate was destabilized and it entered a runaway greenhouse phase. In a third scenario, Venus's inefficient outgassing could have kept water inside the planet, where hydrogen was trapped in the core and the mantle was oxidized. We discuss existing evidence and future observations/missions required to refine our understanding of the planet's history and of the complex feedback cycles between the interior, surface, and atmosphere that have been operating in the past, present or future of Venus.},

This radius valley separates two classes of planets -- usually referred to as "super-Earths" and "mini-Neptunes" -- and its origin remains debated. One model proposes that super-Earths are the outcome of photo-evaporation or core-powered mass-loss stripping the primordial atmospheres of the mini-Neptunes. A contrasting model interprets the radius valley as a dichotomy in the bulk compositions, where super-Earths are rocky planets and mini-Neptunes are water-ice rich worlds. In this work, we test whether the migration model is consistent with the radius valley and how it distinguishes these views. In the migration model, planets migrate towards the disk inner edge forming a chain of planets locked in resonant configurations. After the gas disk dispersal, orbital instabilities "break the chains" and promote late collisions. This model broadly matches the period-ratio and planet-multiplicity distributions of Kepler planets, and accounts for resonant chains such as TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-223, and TOI-178. Here, by combining the outcome of planet formation simulations with compositional mass-radius relationships, and assuming complete loss of primordial H-rich atmospheres in late giant-impacts, we show that the migration model accounts for the exoplanet radius valley and the intra-system uniformity ("peas-in-a-pod") of Kepler planets. Our results suggest that planets with sizes of \${\textbackslash}sim\$1.4 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ are mostly rocky, whereas those with sizes of \${\textbackslash}sim\$2.4 \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ are mostly water-ice rich worlds. Our results do not support an exclusively rocky composition for the cores of mini-Neptunes.},

	abstract = {We present the characterization of the low-gravity M6 dwarf 2MASS J06195260-2903592, previously identified as an unusual field object based on its strong IR excess and variable near-IR spectrum. Multiple epochs of low-resolution (R ≍ 150) near-IR spectra show large-amplitude (≍0.1-0.5 mag) continuum variations on timescales of days to 12 yr, unlike the small-amplitude variability typical for field ultracool dwarfs. The variations between epochs are well-modeled as changes in the relative extinction (ΔA V ≍ 2 mag). Similarly, Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 optical photometry varies on timescales as long as 11 yr (and possibly as short as an hour) and implies comparable A V changes. Near Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mid-IR light curves also suggest changes on 6 month timescales, with amplitudes consistent with the optical/near-IR extinction variations. However, near-IR spectra, near-IR photometry, and optical photometry obtained in the past year indicate that the source can also be stable on hourly and monthly timescales. From comparison to objects of similar spectral type, the total extinction of 2MASS J0619-2903 seems to be A V ≍ 4-6 mag, with perhaps epochs of lower extinction. Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) finds that 2MASS J0619-2903 has a wide-separation (1.'2 = 10,450 au) stellar companion, with an isochronal age of \$\{31\}\_\{-10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+22\}\$ Myr and a mass of \$\{0.30\}\_\{-0.03\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.04\}\$ M ☉. Adopting this companion's age and EDR3 distance (145.2 ± 0.6 pc), we estimate a mass of 0.11-0.17 M ☉ for 2MASS J0619-2903. Altogether, 2MASS J0619-2903 appears to possess an unusually long-lived primordial circumstellar disk, perhaps making it a more obscured analog to the "Peter Pan" disks found around a few M dwarfs in nearby young moving groups.},

Therefore, understanding the responses of power grids to solar superstorms is crucial for space weather research and emergency preparedness purposes. In this work, we combine the Space Weather Modeling Framework with a ground conductivity model and a model of the Chinese Guangdong 500 kV power grid to investigate the response of the whole power grid if the 23 July 2012 solar superstorm had struck the Earth. The maximum {\textbar}GICs{\textbar} produced in the power grid by this event reach approximately 400 A, which is more than thrice those measured during a strong magnetic storm with Kp = 8. Based on statistical analyses of the strength and duration of large GICs at 54 substations and a comparison with the GICs responsible for the Hydro-Québec power outage on 13 March 1989, we stipulate that the risk of GICs in the Guangdong 500 kV power grid is very high. The simulation results also reveal that field-aligned currents can play an important role in producing GICs in middle- and low-latitude power grids during solar superstorms. This finding provides crucial insight for understanding the factors that generate strong GICs at middle and low latitudes.},

The threat of severe damage of power grids due to the GICs is a major concern, in particular, at high latitudes, but is not well understood as for low-latitude power grids. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the lower limit of the GICs that could flow in the Japanese power grid against a Carrington-class severe magnetic storm. On the basis of the geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) observed at Colaba, India, during the Carrington event in 1859, we calculated the geoelectric disturbances (GEDs) by a convolution theory, and calculated GICs flowing through transformers at 3 substations in the Japanese extra-high-voltage (500-kV) power grid by a linear combination of the GEDs. The estimated GEDs could reach {\textasciitilde} 2.5 V/km at Kakioka, and the GICs could reach, at least, 89 ± 30 A near the storm maximum. These values are several times larger than those estimated for the 13–14 March 1989 storm (in which power blackout occurred in Canada), and the 29–31 October 2003 storm (in which power blackout occurred in Sweden). The GICs estimated here are the lower limits, and there is a probability of stronger GICs at other substations. The method introduced here will be immediately applicable for benchmark evaluation of low-latitude GICs against the Carrington-class magnetic storms if one assumes electrical parameters, such as resistance of transmission lines, with sufficient accuracy.},

	abstract = {The rapid development of mega-constellations risks multiple tragedies of the commons, including tragedies to ground-based astronomy, Earth orbit, and Earth’s upper atmosphere. Moreover, the connections between the Earth and space environments are inadequately taken into account by the adoption of a consumer electronic model applied to space assets. For example, we point out that satellite re-entries from the Starlink mega-constellation alone could deposit more aluminum into Earth’s upper atmosphere than what is done through meteoroids; they could thus become the dominant source of high-altitude alumina. Using simple models, we also show that untracked debris will lead to potentially dangerous on-orbit collisions on a regular basis due to the large number of satellites within mega-constellation orbital shells. The total cross-section of satellites in these constellations also greatly increases the risk of impacts due to meteoroids. De facto orbit occupation by single actors, inadequate regulatory frameworks, and the possibility of free-riding exacerbate these risks. International cooperation is urgently needed, along with a regulatory system that takes into account the effects of tens of thousands of satellites.},

Detailed maps and daily resolved time series up to 5 weeks after the first event are compared with the results from a chemistry, transport, and photolysis model of the middle atmosphere that includes NOx and HOx production due to energetic particle precipitation. The general features of the ozone loss are captured by the model fairly well. A strong ozone depletion of more than 50\% even deep into the stratosphere is observed at high geomagnetic latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, whereas the observed ozone depletion in the more sunlit Southern Hemisphere is much weaker. Reasons for these interhemispheric differences are given. Two regimes can be distinguished, one above about 50 km dominated by HOx (H, OH, HO2) driven ozone loss, one below about 50 km, dominated by NOx (NO, NO2) driven ozone loss. The regimes display a different temporal evolution of ozone depletion and recovery. We observe for the first time an establishment of two contemporaneous maxima of ozone depletion at different altitudes, which solely can be explained by these regimes.},

	abstract = {The study of solar flare effects (SFEs) on the ionosphere is having a renaissance. The development of GPS ground and satellite data for scientific use has opened up new means for high time resolution research on SFEs. At present, without continuous flare photon spectra (X rays, EUV, UV, and visible) monitoring instrumentation, the best way to model flare spectral changes within a flare is through ionospheric GPS studies. Flare EUV photons can increase the total electron content of the subsolar ionosphere by up to 30\% in ∼5 min. Energetic particles (ions) of 10 keV to GeV energies are accelerated at the flare site. Electrons with energies up to several MeV are also created. A coronal mass ejection (CME) is launched from the Sun at the time of the flare. Fast interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs) have upstream shocks which accelerate ions to ∼10 keV to ∼10 MeV. Both sources of particles, when magnetically connected to the Earth's magnetosphere, enter the magnetosphere and the high-latitude and midlatitude ionosphere. Those particles that precipitate into the ionosphere cause rapid increases in the polar atmospheric ionization, disruption of transpolar communication, and cause ozone destruction. Complicating the picture, when the ICME reaches the magnetosphere ∼1 to 4 days later, shock compression of the magnetosphere energizes preexisting 10-100 keV magnetospheric electrons and ions, causing precipitation into the dayside auroral zone (∼60°-65° MLAT) ionospheres. Shock compression can also trigger supersubstorms in the magnetotail with concomitant energetic particle precipitation into the nightside auroral zones. If the interplanetary sheath or ICME magnetic fields are southwardly directed and last for several hours, a geomagnetic storm will result. A magnetic storm is characterized by the formation of an unstable ring current with energetic particles in the range ∼10 keV to ∼500 keV. The ring current decays away by precipitation into the middle latitude ionosphere over timescales of ∼10 h. A schematic of a time line for the above SFE ionospheric effects is provided. Descriptions of where in the ionosphere and in what time sequence is provided in the body of the text. Much of the terminology presently in use describing solar, interplanetary, magnetospheric, and ionospheric SFE-related phenomena are dated. We suggest physics-based terms be used in the future.},

	abstract = {We investigate satellite orbital drag effects at low-Earth orbit associated with thermosphere heating during magnetic storms caused by coronal mass ejections. CHAllenge Mini-satellite Payload (CHAMP) and Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) neutral density data are used to compute orbital drag. Storm-to-quiet density comparisons are performed with background densities obtained by the Jacchia-Bowman 2008 (JB2008) empirical model. Our storms are grouped in different categories regarding their intensities as indicated by minimum values of the SYM-H index. We then perform superposed epoch analyses with storm main phase onset as zero epoch time. In general, we find that orbital drag effects are larger for CHAMP (lower altitudes) in comparison to GRACE (higher altitudes). Results show that storm time drag effects manifest first at high latitudes, but for extreme storms, particularly observed by GRACE, stronger orbital drag effects occur during early main phase at low/equatorial latitudes, probably due to heating propagation from high latitudes. We find that storm time orbital decay along the satellites' path generally increases with storm intensity, being stronger and faster for the most extreme events. For these events, orbital drag effects decrease faster probably due to elevated cooling effects caused by nitric oxide, which introduce modeled density uncertainties during storm recovery phase. Errors associated with total orbit decay introduced by JB2008 are generally the largest for the strongest storms and increase during storm times, particular during recovery phases. We discuss the implication of these uncertainties for the prediction of collision between space objects at low-Earth orbit during magnetic storms.},

Our results reveal the high accuracy of the hyperbolic decay function to reproduce the recovery phase of the magnetosphere after an extreme storm. Moreover, the characteristic time that takes the magnetosphere to recover depends in an exponential way on the intensity of the storm, as indicated by the relationship between the two parameters involved in the hyperbolic decay. This exponential function can be approached by a linear function when the severity of the storm diminishes.},

We show that powerful coronal mass ejection (CME) events associated with superflares impacting the Earth magnetosphere with a frequency of 1 event/day. What was the impact of superflares, CMEs and associated solar energetic particle (SEPs) events on the atmospheric erosion of the young Earth and habitability? In this paper we discuss our three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations that show that frequent and energetic CMEs from the early Sun continuously destroyed the sub-solar parts of Earth's magnetosphere at heights {\textless} 1.25 R E . This suggests that CME shock accelerated energetic protons are capable of penetrating into the polar cap region and breaking atmospheric molecular nitrogen, the major ingredient of the early Earth atmosphere, into atomic nitrogen. Photo-collisional dissociation of molecular nitrogen and carbon dioxide creates reactive chemistry that efficiently produces nitrous oxide and hydrogen cyanide, the essential molecule in prebiotic life chemistry. This raises an possibility that frequent super-CMEs could serve as a potential catalyst for the origin of life on early Earth.},

	abstract = {Thousands of exoplanets have now been discovered with a huge range of masses, sizes and orbits: from rocky Earth-like planets to large gas giants grazing the surface of their host star. However, the essential nature of these exoplanets remains largely mysterious: there is no known, discernible pattern linking the presence, size, or orbital parameters of a planet to the nature of its parent star. We have little idea whether the chemistry of a planet is linked to its formation environment, or whether the type of host star drives the physics and chemistry of the planet's birth, and evolution. ARIEL was conceived to observe a large number ( 1000) of transiting planets for statistical understanding, including gas giants, Neptunes, super-Earths and Earth-size planets around a range of host star types using transit spectroscopy in the 1.25-7.8 μm spectral range and multiple narrow-band photometry in the optical. ARIEL will focus on warm and hot planets to take advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres which should show minimal condensation and sequestration of high-Z materials compared to their colder Solar System siblings. Said warm and hot atmospheres are expected to be more representative of the planetary bulk composition. Observations of these warm/hot exoplanets, and in particular of their elemental composition (especially C, O, N, S, Si), will allow the understanding of the early stages of planetary and atmospheric formation during the nebular phase and the following few million years. ARIEL will thus provide a representative picture of the chemical nature of the exoplanets and relate this directly to the type and chemical environment of the host star. ARIEL is designed as a dedicated survey mission for combined-light spectroscopy, capable of observing a large and well-defined planet sample within its 4-year mission lifetime. Transit, eclipse and phase-curve spectroscopy methods, whereby the signal from the star and planet are differentiated using knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, allow us to measure atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of 10-100 part per million (ppm) relative to the star and, given the bright nature of targets, also allows more sophisticated techniques, such as eclipse mapping, to give a deeper insight into the nature of the atmosphere. These types of observations require a stable payload and satellite platform with broad, instantaneous wavelength coverage to detect many molecular species, probe the thermal structure, identify clouds and monitor the stellar activity. The wavelength range proposed covers all the expected major atmospheric gases from e.g. H2O, CO2, CH4 NH3, HCN, H2S through to the more exotic metallic compounds, such as TiO, VO, and condensed species. Simulations of ARIEL performance in conducting exoplanet surveys have been performed - using conservative estimates of mission performance and a full model of all significant noise sources in the measurement - using a list of potential ARIEL targets that incorporates the latest available exoplanet statistics. The conclusion at the end of the Phase A study, is that ARIEL - in line with the stated mission objectives - will be able to observe about 1000 exoplanets depending on the details of the adopted survey strategy, thus confirming the feasibility of the main science objectives.},

Here, we conducted two observations with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder Telescope totalling 26 h and scheduled to overlap with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite Sector 36 field, utilizing the wide fields of view of both telescopes to search for multiple M dwarfs. We detected variable radio emission in Stokes I centred at 888 MHz from four known active M dwarfs. Two of these sources were also detected with Stokes V circular polarization. When examining the detected radio emission characteristics, we were not able to distinguish between the models for either electron cyclotron maser or gyrosynchrotron emission. These detections add to the growing number of M dwarfs observed with variable low-frequency emission.},

Transmission spectroscopy of transiting exoplanets provides our best opportunity to identify the makeup of planetary atmospheres in the coming decade. Stellar brightness variations due to star spots, however, can impact these measurements and contaminate the observed spectra. Pandora's goal is to disentangle star and planet signals in transmission spectra to reliably determine exoplanet atmosphere compositions. Pandora will collect long-duration photometric observations with a visible-light channel and simultaneous spectra with a near-IR channel. The broad-wavelength coverage will provide constraints on the spot and faculae covering fractions of low-mass exoplanet host stars and the impact of these active regions on exoplanetary transmission spectra. Pandora will subsequently identify exoplanets with hydrogen- or water-dominated atmospheres, and robustly determine which planets are covered by clouds and hazes. Pandora will observe at least 20 exoplanets with sizes ranging from Earth-size to Jupiter-size and host stars spanning mid-K to late-M spectral types. The project is made possible by leveraging investments in other projects, including an all-aluminum 0.45-meter Cassegrain telescope design, and a NIR sensor chip assembly from the James Webb Space Telescope. The mission will last five years from initial formulation to closeout, with one-year of science operations. Launch is planned for the mid-2020s as a secondary payload in Sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit. By design, Pandora has a diverse team, with over half of the mission leadership roles filled by early career scientists and engineers, demonstrating the high value of SmallSats for developing the next generation of space mission leaders.},

	abstract = {Stellar flares of active M dwarfs can affect the atmospheric composition of close-orbiting gas giants, and can result in time-dependent transmission spectra. We aim to examine the impact of a variety of flares, differing in energy, duration, and occurrence frequency, on the composition and spectra of close-orbiting, tidally locked gaseous planets with climates dominated by equatorial superrotation. We used a series of pseudo-2D photo- and thermochemical kinetics models, which take advection by the equatorial jet stream into account, to simulate the neutral molecular composition of a gaseous planet (effective temperature 800 K) that orbits a flaring M dwarf. We then computed transmission spectra for the evening and morning limb. We find that the upper regions of the dayside and evening limb are heavily depleted in CH4 and NH3 up to several days after a flare with a total radiative energy of \$ 2 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{33\} \$ erg. Molar fractions of C2H2 and HCN are enhanced up to a factor three on the nightside and morning limb after day-to-nightside advection of photodissociated species. CH4 depletion reduces transit depths by 100-300 parts per million (ppm) on the evening limb and C2H2 production increases the 14 micron feature up to 350 ppm on the morning limb. We find that repeated flaring drives the atmosphere to a composition that differs from its pre-flare distribution and that this translates to a permanent modification of the transmission spectrum. We show that single high-energy flares can affect the atmospheres of close-orbiting gas giants up to several days after the flare event, during which their transmission spectra are altered by several hundred ppm. Repeated flaring has important implications for future retrieval analyses of exoplanets around active stars, as the atmospheric composition and resulting spectral signatures substantially differ from models that do not include flaring.},

	abstract = {Although high energetic radiation from flares is a potential threat to exoplanet atmospheres and may lead to surface sterilization, it might also provide the extra energy for low-mass stars needed to trigger and sustain prebiotic chemistry. We investigate two flares on TRAPPIST-1, an ultra-cool dwarf star that hosts seven exoplanets of which three lie within its habitable zone. The flares are detected in all four passbands of the MuSCAT2 allowing a determination of their temperatures and bolometric energies. We analyzed the light curves of the MuSCAT1 and MuSCAT2 instruments obtained between 2016 and 2021 in \$g,r,i,z\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}\$-filters. We conducted an automated flare search and visually confirmed possible flare events. We studied the temperature evolution, the global temperature, and the peak temperature of both flares. For the first time we infer effective black body temperatures of flares that occurred on TRAPPIST-1. The black body temperatures for the two TRAPPIST-1 flares derived from the SED are consistent with \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SED\} = 7940\_\{-390\}{\textasciicircum}\{+430\}\$K and \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SED\} = 6030\_\{-270\}{\textasciicircum}\{+300\}\$K. The flare black body temperatures at the peak are also calculated from the peak SED yielding \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SEDp\} = 13620\_\{-1220\}{\textasciicircum}\{1520\}\$K and \$T\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{SEDp\} = 8290\_\{-550\}{\textasciicircum}\{+660\}\$K. We show that for the ultra-cool M-dwarf TRAPPIST-1 the flare black body temperatures associated with the total continuum emission are lower and not consistent with the usually adopted assumption of 9000-10000 K. This could imply different and faster cooling mechanisms. Further multi-color observations are needed to investigate whether or not our observations are a general characteristic of ultra-cool M-dwarfs. This would have significant implications for the habitability of exoplanets around these stars because the UV surface flux is likely to be overestimated by the models with higher flare temperatures.},

	abstract = {We present a homogeneous analysis of line and continuum emission from simultaneous high-cadence spectra and photometry covering near-ultraviolet and optical wavelengths for 20 M dwarf flares. These data were obtained to study the white-light continuum components at bluer and redder wavelengths than the Balmer jump. Our goals were to break the degeneracy between emission mechanisms that have been fit to broadband colors of flares and to provide constraints for radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) flare models that seek to reproduce the white-light flare emission. The main results from the analysis are the following: (1) the detection of Balmer continuum (in emission) that is present during all flares and with a wide range of relative contributions to the continuum flux at bluer wavelengths than the Balmer jump; (2) a blue continuum at flare maximum that is linearly decreasing with wavelength from λ = 4000–4800 Å, indicative of hot, blackbody emission with typical temperatures of TBB ∼ 9000–14, 000 K; (3) a redder continuum apparent at wavelengths longer than Hβ (λ ≳ 4900 Å) which becomes relatively more important to the energy budget during the late gradual phase. The hot blackbody component and redder continuum component have been detected in previous studies of flares. However, we have found that although the hot blackbody emission component is relatively well-represented by a featureless, single-temperature Planck function, this component includes absorption features and has a continuum shape strikingly similar to the spectrum of an A-type star as directly observed in our flare spectra. New model constraints are presented for the time evolution among the hydrogen Balmer lines and between Ca ii K and the blackbody continuum emission. We calculate Balmer jump flux ratios and compare to the solar-type flare heating predictions from RHD models. The model ratios are too large and the blue-optical (λ = 4000–4800 Å) slopes are too red in both the impulsive and gradual decay phases of all 20 flares. This discrepancy implies that further work is needed to understand the heating at high column mass during dMe flares.},

	abstract = {We present a new method to detect planetary transits from time-series photometry, the transit least squares (TLS) algorithm. TLS searches for transit-like features while taking the stellar limb darkening and planetary ingress and egress into account. We have optimized TLS for both signal detection efficiency (SDE) of small planets and computational speed. TLS analyses the entire, unbinned phase-folded light curve. We compensated for the higher computational load by (i.) using algorithms such as "Mergesort" (for the trial orbital phases) and by (ii.) restricting the trial transit durations to a smaller range that encompasses all known planets, and using stellar density priors where available. A typical K2 light curve, including 80 d of observations at a cadence of 30 min, can be searched with TLS in ∼10 s real time on a standard laptop computer, as fast as the widely used box least squares (BLS) algorithm. We perform a transit injection-retrieval experiment of Earth-sized planets around sun-like stars using synthetic light curves with 110 ppm white noise per 30 min cadence, corresponding to a photometrically quiet K{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}P{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 12 star observed with Kepler. We determine the SDE thresholds for both BLS and TLS to reach a false positive rate of 1\% to be SDE = 7 in both cases. The resulting true positive (or recovery) rates are ∼93\% for TLS and ∼76\% for BLS, implying more reliable detections with TLS. We also test TLS with the K2 light curve of the TRAPPIST-1 system and find six of seven Earth-sized planets using an iterative search for increasingly lower signal detection efficiency, the phase-folded transit of the seventh planet being affected by a stellar flare. TLS is more reliable than BLS in finding any kind of transiting planet but it is particularly suited for the detection of small planets in long time series from Kepler, TESS, and PLATO. We make our python implementation of TLS publicly available.},

The sizes of flare emission cores in three wavelengths are accurately measured during the peak of the flare. The source size is the largest in the G band at 4308 Å and shrinks toward longer wavelengths, namely the green continuum at 5200 Å and NIR at 15600 Å, where the emission is believed to originate from the deeper atmosphere. This size-wavelength variation is likely explained by the direct heating model as electrons need to move along converging field lines from the corona to the photosphere. Therefore, one can observe the smallest source, which in our case is 0farcs65 ± 0farcs02 in the bottom layer (represented by NIR), and observe relatively larger kernels in upper layers of 1farcs03 ± 0farcs14 and 1farcs96 ± 0farcs27, using the green continuum and G band, respectively. We then compare the source sizes with a simple magnetic geometry to derive the formation height of the white-light sources and magnetic pressure in different layers inside the flare loop.},

	abstract = {We consider the evaporation of close-in planets by the star's intrinsic extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray radiation. We calculate evaporation rates by solving the hydrodynamical problem for planetary evaporation including heating from both X-ray and EUV radiation. We show that most close-in planets (a {\textless} 0.1 au) are evaporating hydrodynamically, with the evaporation occurring in two distinct regimes: X-ray driven, in which the X-ray heated flow contains a sonic point, and EUV driven, in which the X-ray region is entirely sub-sonic. The mass-loss rates scale as LX/a2 for X-ray driven evaporation, and as Φ*1/2/a for EUV driven evaporation at early times, with mass-loss rates of the order of 1010-1014 g s-1. No exact scaling exists for the mass-loss rate with planet mass and planet radius; however, in general evaporation proceeds more rapidly for planets with lower densities and higher masses. Furthermore, we find that in general the transition from X-ray driven to EUV driven evaporation occurs at lower X-ray luminosities for planets closer to their parent stars and for planets with lower densities. Coupling our evaporation models to the evolution of the high-energy radiation - which falls with time - we are able to follow the evolution of evaporating planets. We find that most planets start off evaporating in the X-ray driven regime, but switch to EUV driven once the X-ray luminosity falls below a critical value. The evolution models suggest that while 'hot Jupiters' are evaporating, they are not evaporating at a rate sufficient to remove the entire gaseous envelope on Gyr time-scales. However, we do find that close in Neptune mass planets are more susceptible to complete evaporation of their envelopes. Thus we conclude that planetary evaporation is more important for lower mass planets, particularly those in the 'hot Neptune'/'super Earth' regime.},

The corresponding total flare energy in white light is estimated to be 1.2 x 10 exp 32 ergs. This estimate, combined with the 700-s duration of the U-band event, yields an average white-light flare luminosity which is about 3 percent of the quiescent stellar bolometric luminosity. Strong H-alpha wings appeared after the impulsive phase. A discernible central reversal is present in both the quiescent H-alpha profile and, significantly, in the flare profile following the impulsive phase. It is suggested that the site of H-alpha flare emission is not necessarily associated with a compact, high pressure region. The flare-enhanced line emission arises from large flare volumes that are, in turn, a distinguishing feature of stellar flares of this magnitude.},

We find dark spots located at low latitudes. We also detect prominences below the co-rotation radius and at low latitudes, coinciding with the spot latitudes. This apparent low-latitude activity contrasts with what is typically observed in fast rotators, which tend to form large polar spots. Moreover, we detect a stellar flare that produces an enhancement of the continuum and additional emission in the core of most photospheric and chromospheric lines. We find evidence that the flare is ignited above an active region, as seen in solar flares. This means that, with high probability, the flare is initiated by magnetic reconnection in complex active regions. We also present evidence of bulk redshifted velocities of about 15 km s-1 during the rise of the flare, and velocities of 5-10 km s-1 during the decay phase. An estimation of the heating during the flare results in about 200 kK close to the peak and in 100 kK at the end of the observations.},

At the same time, the total emission of the core increased nearly twenty times. This distinct behavior indicates that different heating mechanisms might be responsible for core and halo emissions. In addition to the temporal analysis, we compared the intensity enhancements of the flare core and halo. The result shows that the halo contrast increased by about 8\% compared to the flare-quiet region, which could be explained by a combination of direct-heating and backwarming models.},

By making non-LTE model calculations, we find that in the early phase, when the electron beam bombards an unheated atmosphere, the non-thermal ionization by the beam results in an increased H{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} opacity which then reduces the emergent intensity. With the flare development, the atmosphere is gradually heated. In particular, radiative backwarming plays a chief role in the heating of the temperature minimum region and upper photosphere. We estimate the temperature rise in these regions for a fully heated atmosphere in which energy balance is attained. In this case, the continuum emission rises above the quiescent value. Therefore, this corresponds to the flare maximum phase. We further find that the energy flux of the electron beam deduced from the hard X-ray emission is large enough to account for the continuum contrast.},

The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

In other words, more data actually hurts the estimator. This behavior is implicit in a recent line of theoretical works analyzing "double-descent" phenomenon in linear models. In this note, we isolate and understand this behavior in an extremely simple setting: linear regression with isotropic Gaussian covariates. In particular, this occurs due to an unconventional type of bias-variance tradeoff in the overparameterized regime: the bias decreases with more samples, but variance increases.},

We unify the above phenomena by deﬁning a new complexity measure we call the effective model complexity and conjecture a generalized double descent with respect to this measure.

	abstract = {Twenty-three giant flares from thirteen active stars (eight RS CVn systems, one Algol system, three dMe stars, and one young stellar object) were detected during the first two years of our all-sky X-ray monitoring with the gas propotional counters (GSC) of the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI). The observed parameters of all these MAXI/GSC flares are found to be at the upper ends for stellar flares with the luminosity of 1031-34 erg s-1 in the 2-20 keV band, the emission measure of 1054-57 cm-3, the e-folding time of 1 hr to 1.5 d, and the total radiative energy released during the flare of 1034-39 erg. Notably, the peak X-ray luminosity of 5{\textasciicircum}\{+4\}\_\{-2\} × 10{\textasciicircum}\{33\}erg s-1 in the 2-20 keV band was detected in one of the flares on II Peg, which is one of the, or potentially the, largest-ever-observed in stellar flares. X-ray flares were detected from GT Mus, V841 Cen, SZ Psc, and TWA-7 for the first time in this survey. Whereas most of our detected sources are multiple-star systems, two of them are single stars (YZ CMi and TWA-7). Among the stellar sources within 100 pc distance, the MAXI/GSC sources have larger rotation velocities than the other sources. This suggests that the rapid rotation velocity may play a key role in generating large flares. Combining the X-ray flare data of nearby stars and the sun, taken from literature and our own data, we discovered a universal correlation of τ ∝ L\_X{\textasciicircum}\{0.2\} for the flare duration τ and the intrinsic X-ray luminosity LX in the 0.1-100 keV band, which holds for 5 and 12 orders of magnitude in τ and LX, respectively. The MAXI/GSC sample is located at the highest ends of the correlation.},

However, the data processing is made more challenging by the reduced pointing accuracy of the satellite, which has only two functioning reaction wheels. We present a new method to extract precise light curves from K2 data, combining list-driven, soft-edged aperture photometry with a star-by-star correction of systematic effects associated with the drift in the roll angle of the satellite about its boresight. The systematics are modelled simultaneously with the stars' intrinsic variability using a semiparametric Gaussian process model. We test this method on a week of data collected during an engineering test in 2014 January, perform checks to verify that our method does not alter intrinsic variability signals, and compute the precision as a function of magnitude on long-cadence (30 min) and planetary transit (2.5 h) time-scales. In both cases, we reach photometric precisions close to the precision reached during the nominal Kepler mission for stars fainter than 12th magnitude, and between 40 and 80 parts per million for brighter stars. These results confirm the bright prospects for planet detection and characterization, asteroseismology and stellar variability studies with K2. Finally, we perform a basic transit search on the light curves, detecting two bona fide transit-like events, seven detached eclipsing binaries and 13 classical variables.},

	abstract = {The Matuyama-Brunhes reversal of Earth's magnetic dipole field took place 0.78 Ma ago, and detailed temporally resolved paleomagnetic data are available for this period. A geomagnetic reversal is expected to impact the cosmic ray flux, which in turn might impact atmospheric ionization rates. In this study a model that yields atmospheric ionization for the entire globe based on an input magnetic field is presented. Taking the time dependent paleomagnetic data as input, a 3D time series of the atmospheric ionization rates during the reversal is produced. We show, that as the dipole field weakens, the atmospheric ionization increases at low latitudes. The increase is ca. 25\% at the surface and up to a factor of 5 in the upper atmosphere. Globally, ionization rates increase around 13\% at the surface and up to a factor of 2 in the upper atmosphere, whereas polar regions are largely unaffected. Finally, the change in ionization due to the solar 11-year cycle is greatly affected by the reversal. The relative change in atmospheric ionization between solar-minimum and solar-maximum varies between 2 and two orders of magnitude. All atmospheric ionization data is made available for download.},

	abstract = {The detected exoplanet population displays a dearth of planets with sizes of about two Earth radii, the so-called radius gap. This is interpreted as an evolutionary effect driven by a variety of possible atmospheric mass loss processes of exoplanets. For mass loss driven by an exoplanet's irradiation by stellar X-ray and extreme-UV photons, the time evolution of the stellar magnetic activity is important. It is known from observations of open stellar clusters that stars of the same age and mass do not all follow the same time evolution of activity-induced X-ray and extreme-UV luminosities. Here we explore how a realistic spread of different stellar activity tracks influences the mass loss and radius evolution of a simulated population of small exoplanets and the observable properties of the radius gap. Our results show qualitatively that different saturation time scales, i.e. the young age at which stellar high-energy emission starts to decline, and different activity decay tracks over moderate stellar ages can cause changes in the population density of planets in the gap, as well as in the observable width of the gap. We also find that while the first 100 million years of mass loss are highly important to shape the radius gap, significant evolution of the gap properties is expected to take place for at least the first 500-600 million years, i.e. the age of the Hyades cluster. Observations of exoplanet populations with defined ages will be able to shed more light on the radius gap evolution.},

The large area and time-domain surveys planned for the cosmology and exoplanet microlensing programs will produce extraordinarily rich data sets that enable an enormous range of Archival Research (AR) investigations. Requirements for the coronagraph are defined based on its status as a technology demonstration, but its expected performance will enable unprecedented observations of nearby giant exoplanets and circumstellar disks.

We revisit the problem of identifying faint echoes in postflare light curves, focusing on debris disks from ongoing planet formation. Starting with simulations, we develop an algorithm for estimating the radial extent and total mass from disk echo profiles. We apply this algorithm to light curves from over 2100 stars observed by NASA's Kepler mission, selected for multiple short-lived flares in either the long-cadence or short-cadence data sets. While flux uncertainties in light curves from individual stars preclude useful mass limits on circumstellar disks, catalog-averaged light curves yield constraints on disk mass that are comparable to estimates from known debris disks. The average mass in micron- to millimeter-sized dust around the Kepler stars cannot exceed 10\% of an Earth mass in exo-Kuiper belts or 10\% of a lunar mass in the terrestrial zone. We group stars according to IR excess, based on WISE W1-W3 color, as an indicator for the presence of circumstellar dust. The mass limits are greater for stars with strong IR excess, a hint that echoes are lurking not far beneath the noise in postflare light curves. With increased sensitivity, echo detection will let time-domain astronomy complement spectroscopic and direct-imaging studies in mapping how, when, and where planets form.},

	abstract = {We present the results of an observational campaign which obtained high-cadence, high-precision, simultaneous optical and IR photometric observations of three M dwarf flare stars for 47 hr. The campaign was designed to characterize the behavior of energetic flare events, which routinely occur on M dwarfs, at IR wavelengths to millimagnitude precision, and quantify to what extent such events might influence current and future efforts to detect and characterize extrasolar planets surrounding these stars. We detected and characterized four highly energetic optical flares having U-band total energies of {\textasciitilde}7.8 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}30{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} to {\textasciitilde}1.3 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}32{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg, and found no corresponding response in the J, H, or Ks bandpasses at the precision of our data. For active dM3e stars, we find that a {\textasciitilde}1.3 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}32{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg U-band flare (ΔU {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}max{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 1.5 mag) will induce \&lt;8.3 (J), \&lt;8.5 (H), and \&lt;11.7 (Ks) mmag of a response. A flare of this energy or greater should occur less than once per 18 hr. For active dM4.5e stars, we find that a {\textasciitilde}5.1 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}31{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg U-band flare (ΔU {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}max{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} {\textasciitilde} 1.6 mag) will induce \&lt;7.8 (J), \&lt;8.8 (H), and \&lt;5.1 (Ks) mmag of a response. A flare of this energy or greater should occur less than once per 10 hr. No evidence of stellar variability not associated with discrete flare events was observed at the level of {\textasciitilde}3.9 mmag over 1 hr timescales and at the level of {\textasciitilde}5.6 mmag over 7.5 hr timescales. We therefore demonstrate that most M dwarf stellar activity and flares will not influence IR detection and characterization studies of M dwarf exoplanets above the level of {\textasciitilde}5-11 mmag, depending on the filter and spectral type. We speculate that the most energetic megaflares on M dwarfs, which occur at rates of once per month, are likely to be easily detected in IR observations with sensitivity of tens of millimagnitudes. We also discuss how recent detections of line flux enhancements during M dwarf flares could influence IR transmission spectroscopic observations of M dwarf exoplanets.},

On four repeat observations, however, the spectrum was that of a more ordinary dMe object, albeit with a late spectral type of M9.5 V. Our interpretation is that the object underwent an extreme magnetic flare event. The continuum flux at the short-wavelength end of the spectrum was also several times stronger during the apparent flare than in quiescence. Comparison is made with midtype M dwarfs of higher mass that have undergone strong flares, and with another known M9.5 emission-line object PC 0025+0047. The 2MASS object adds to the evidence that magnetic dynamo eruptions may release more energy relative to Lbol as the stellar mass decreases; if the total flare luminosity scales with Hα in the same way as a well-observed event of the middle M dwarf AD Leo, 2M0149 may have had a flare luminosity that approached or exceeded its quiescent Lbol during the brief impulse phase. In contrast, its quiescent state shows an unremarkable level of chromospheric activity, which leads us to question whether it is unique at all; rather, it may be that many of the ultracool M and L dwarfs found by the Deep Near-Infrared Survey (DENIS) and 2MASS undergo similar flares.

Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

We present original spectra of the NaI doublet and the CaII IR triplet for active dMe stars and less active dM stars. Core emission is detected in the Sodium lines and the CaII IR triplet lines for the most active M dwarf AU Mic. We investigate the difference spectra between active dMe stars and dM stars and show that these provide interesting new constraints for the NLTE-radiation transfer modelling of the chromospheres. In our sample, emission Hα profiles have a rather homogeneous FWHM of about 1.5 Å. This, according to our previous modelling, can be interpreted as the signature of a rather constant temperature break in the chromosphere. We found that one of our targets (MCC 332) is a binary with a faint but active Hα emission component. For the first time we detect the Paɛ line for six dwarfs. It appears as weak absorption with possible weak wing emission in AU Mic. The region of the Pa\{8\} line was observed but the line was not detected. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile.},

The strongest flare (Δu = 4.02 on EV Lac) showed emission from Hγ, Hδ, He I λ4471, and Ca II K in the UV/blue and Pβ, Pγ, Pδ, Brγ, and He I λ10830 in the infrared.

The strongest infrared emission line, Pβ, occurred in the active mid-M dwarfs with a duty cycle of {\textasciitilde}3\%-4\%. To examine the most energetic flare, we used the static NLTE radiative transfer code RH to produce model spectra based on a suite of one-dimensional model atmospheres.

	abstract = {We present the results of an observational campaign which obtained high-cadence, high-precision, simultaneous optical and IR photometric observations of three M dwarf flare stars for 47 hr. The campaign was designed to characterize the behavior of energetic flare events, which routinely occur on M dwarfs, at IR wavelengths to millimagnitude precision, and quantify to what extent such events might influence current and future efforts to detect and characterize extrasolar planets surrounding these stars. We detected and characterized four highly energetic optical flares having U-band total energies of {\textasciitilde}7.8 × 1030 to {\textasciitilde}1.3 × 1032 erg, and found no corresponding response in the J, H, or Ks bandpasses at the precision of our data. For active dM3e stars, we find that a {\textasciitilde}1.3 × 1032 erg U-band flare (ΔU max {\textasciitilde} 1.5 mag) will induce {\textless}8.3 (J), {\textless}8.5 (H), and {\textless}11.7 (Ks) mmag of a response. A flare of this energy or greater should occur less than once per 18 hr. For active dM4.5e stars, we find that a {\textasciitilde}5.1 × 1031 erg U-band flare (ΔU max {\textasciitilde} 1.6 mag) will induce {\textless}7.8 (J), {\textless}8.8 (H), and {\textless}5.1 (Ks) mmag of a response. A flare of this energy or greater should occur less than once per 10 hr. No evidence of stellar variability not associated with discrete flare events was observed at the level of {\textasciitilde}3.9 mmag over 1 hr timescales and at the level of {\textasciitilde}5.6 mmag over 7.5 hr timescales. We therefore demonstrate that most M dwarf stellar activity and flares will not influence IR detection and characterization studies of M dwarf exoplanets above the level of {\textasciitilde}5-11 mmag, depending on the filter and spectral type. We speculate that the most energetic megaflares on M dwarfs, which occur at rates of once per month, are likely to be easily detected in IR observations with sensitivity of tens of millimagnitudes. We also discuss how recent detections of line flux enhancements during M dwarf flares could influence IR transmission spectroscopic observations of M dwarf exoplanets.},

	abstract = {We report on radiative hydrodynamic simulations of M dwarf stellar flares and compare the model predictions to observations of several flares. The flares were simulated by calculating the hydrodynamic response of a model M dwarf atmosphere to a beam of nonthermal electrons. Radiative back-warming through numerous soft X-ray, extreme-ultraviolet, and ultraviolet transitions are also included. The equations of radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium are treated in non-LTE for many transitions of hydrogen, helium, and the Ca II ion, allowing the calculation of detailed line profiles and continuum radiation. Two simulations were carried out, with electron beam fluxes corresponding to moderate and strong beam heating. In both cases we find that the dynamics can be naturally divided into two phases: an initial gentle phase in which hydrogen and helium radiate away much of the beam energy and an explosive phase characterized by large hydrodynamic waves. During the initial phase, lower chromospheric material is evaporated into higher regions of the atmosphere, causing many lines and continua to brighten dramatically. The He II 304 line is especially enhanced, becoming the brightest line in the flaring spectrum. The hydrogen Balmer lines also become much brighter and show very broad line widths, in agreement with observations. We compare our predicted Balmer decrements to decrements calculated for several flare observations and find the predictions to be in general agreement with the observations. During the explosive phase both condensation and evaporation waves are produced. The moderate flare simulation predicts a peak evaporation wave of {\textasciitilde}130 km s-1 and a condensation wave of {\textasciitilde}30 km s-1. The velocity of the condensation wave matches velocities observed in several transition region lines. The optical continuum also greatly intensifies, reaching a peak increase of 130\% (at 6000 Å) for the strong flare, but does not match observed white-light spectra.},

	abstract = {The empirical relationship between the nonthermal 5 GHz radio luminosity and the soft X-ray luminosity of active stellar coronae, canonically called the Güdel-Benz relationship, has been a cornerstone of stellar radio astronomy, as it explicitly ties the radio emission to the coronal heating mechanisms. The relationship extends from microflares on the Sun to the coronae of the most active stars suggesting that active coronae are heated by a flare-like process. The relationship is thought to originate from a consistent partition of the available flare energy into relativistic charges, which emit in the radio-band via the incoherent gyrosynchrotron mechanism, and heating of the bulk coronal plasma, which emits in the X-ray band via the Bremsstrahlung mechanism. Consequently, coherent emission from stellar and substellar objects is not expected to adhere to this empirical relationship, as it is observed in ultracool dwarf stars and brown dwarfs. Here we report a population of radio-detected chromospherically active stars that surprisingly follow the Güdel-Benz relationship despite their radio emission being classified as coherent emission by virtue of its high circularly polarized fraction and high brightness temperature. Our results prompt a reexamination of the physics behind the Güdel-Benz relationship, its implication for the mechanism of coronal heating and particle acceleration in active stars, and the phenomenological connection between solar and stellar flares.},

	abstract = {Observations of surface magnetic fields of cool stars reveal a large diversity of configurations. Although there is now a consensus that these fields are generated through dynamo processes occurring within the convective zone, the physical mechanism driving such a variety of field topologies is still debated. This paper discusses the possible origins of dipole and multipole-dominated morphologies using three-dimensional numerical simulations of stratified systems where the magnetic feedback on the fluid motion is significant. Our main result is that dipolar solutions are found at Rossby numbers up to 0.4 in strongly stratified simulations, where previous works suggested that only multipolar fields should exist. We argue that these simulations are reminiscent of the outlier stars observed at Rossby numbers larger than 0.1, whose large-scale magnetic field is dominated by their axisymmetric poloidal component. As suggested in previous Boussinesq calculations, the relative importance of inertial over Lorentz forces is again controlling the dipolar to multipolar transition. Alternatively, we find that the ratio of kinetic to magnetic energies can equally well capture the transition in the field morphology. We test the ability of this new proxy to predict the magnetic morphology of a few M-dwarf stars whose internal structure matches that of our simulations and for which homogeneous magnetic field characterization is available. Finally, the magnitude of the differential rotation obtained in our simulations is compared to actual measurements reported in the literature for M-dwarfs. In our simulations, we find a clear relationship between anti-solar differential rotation and the emergence of dipolar fields.},

	abstract = {The intermediate period gap, discovered by Kepler, is an observed dearth of stellar rotation periods in the temperature-period diagram at \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 20 days for G dwarfs and up to \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 30 days for early-M dwarfs. However, because Kepler mainly targeted solar-like stars, there is a lack of measured periods for M dwarfs, especially those at the fully convective limit. Therefore it is unclear if the intermediate period gap exists for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Here, we present a period catalog containing 40,553 rotation periods (9,535 periods \${\textgreater}\$ 10 days), measured using the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). To measure these periods, we developed a simple pipeline that improves directly on the ZTF archival light curves and reduces the photometric scatter by 26\%, on average. This new catalog spans a range of stellar temperatures that connect samples from Kepler with MEarth, a ground-based time domain survey of bright M-dwarfs, and reveals that the intermediate period gap closes at the theoretically predicted location of the fully convective boundary (\$G\_\{{\textbackslash}rm BP\} - G\_\{{\textbackslash}rm RP\} {\textbackslash}sim 2.45\$ mag). This result supports the hypothesis that the gap is caused by core-envelope interactions. Using gyro-kinematic ages, we also find a potential rapid spin-down of stars across this period gap.},

Systematic analyses of Sun-as-a-star observations to develop and improve stellar CME detection techniques and alternatives; (3.)

Our understanding of this mechanism is mainly limited by our capability of inferring the properties of stellar turbulent convection.

In this work, we propose a new calibration of the (B − V) color index dependence of the convective turnover time, hence, of the stellar Rossby number. Our new calibration is based on the stellar structure properties inferred through the detailed modeling of solar-like pulsators using asteroseismic observables.

We provide a catalog with the atmospheric parameters (T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, log g, and [Fe/H]), radial velocity (RV), and projected rotation velocity (v sin i). For cool stars (T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≤ 6500 K), we also calculated the Ha and Li Iλ6708 equivalent width, which are important indicators of chromospheric activity and evolutionary stage, respectively. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: From the sample of 16 300 spectra, we have derived the RV and atmospheric parameters for 14 300 spectra of 7443 stars. Literature data (mainly from high- or medium-resolution spectra) were used for a quality control of the results and to assess the accuracy of the derived parameters. The T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and log g values are in good agreement with the literature, although their distribution displays some clustering effects, which may be the result of the nonuniform distribution of the templates in the parameter space. The most relevant differences are found for [Fe/H], which appears to be overestimated for metal-poor stars; this overestimation is also likely due to the template grid. We propose a relation to correct the [Fe/H] values derived with ROTFIT. We were able to identify interesting objects, such as double-lined binaries, stars with variable RVs, lithium-rich giants, and emission-line objects. Based on the Hα flux, we found 327 active stars. We were able to detect the Li Iλ6708 line and measure its equivalent width for 1657 stars, both giants and stars on the main sequence. Regarding the latter, we performed a discrete age classification based on the atmospheric lithium abundance and the upper envelopes of a few open clusters. Among the giants, we found 195 Li-rich stars, 161 of which are reported here for the first time. No relationship is found between stellar rotation and lithium abundance, which allows us to rule out merger scenarios as the predominant explanation of the enrichment of Li in our sample. The fraction of Li-rich giants, ≈ 4\%, is higher than expected. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Tables C.2, C.3, 2, 3, and 4 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/664/A78"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/664/A78{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

However, it is disputed, whether scaling up a solar-type dynamo could explain such a magnitude difference. We investigate the flaring activity of KIC 2852961, a late-type spotted giant. We seek for flares in the Kepler Q0-Q17 datasets by an automated technique together with visual inspection. Flare occurence rate and flare energies are analyzed and compared to flare statistics of different targets with similar flare activity at different energy levels. We find that the flare energy distribution of KIC 2852961 does not seem to be consistent with that of superflares on solar-type stars. Also, we believe that in case of KIC 2852961 spot activity should have an important role in producing such superflares.},

	abstract = {M dwarfs remain active over longer timescales than their Sunlike counterparts, with potentially devastating implications for the atmospheres of their planets. However, the age at which fully convective M dwarfs transition from active and rapidly rotating to quiescent and slowly rotating is poorly understood, as these stars remain rapidly rotating in the oldest clusters that are near enough for a large sample of low-mass M dwarfs to be studied. To constrain the spindown of these low-mass stars, we measure photometric rotation periods for field M dwarfs in wide binary systems, primarily using the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and MEarth. Our analysis includes M-M pairs, which are coeval but of unknown age, as well as M dwarfs with white dwarf or Sunlike primaries, for which we can estimate ages using techniques like white-dwarf cooling curves, gyrochronology, and lithium abundance. We find that the epoch of spindown is strongly dependent on mass. Fully convective M dwarfs initially spin down slowly, with the population of 0.2-0.3 M ⊙ rapid rotators evolving from P rot {\textless} 2 days at 600 Myr to 2 {\textless} P rot {\textless} 10 days at 1-3 Gyr before rapidly spinning down to long rotation periods at older ages. However, we also identify some variability in the spindown of fully convective M dwarfs, with a small number of stars having substantially spun down by 600 Myr. These observations are consistent with models of magnetic morphology-driven spindown, where angular momentum loss is initially inefficient until changes in the magnetic field allow spindown to progress rapidly.},

Both components of these binaries are found to be active. The X-ray light curves of detached and semidetached type systems show eclipsed-like features, whereas no evidence for coronal eclipsing is shown by the contact type systems. The X-ray light curve of DV Psc shows the O'Connell-like effect where the first maximum is found to be brighter than that of the second. Results of the coronal imaging using three-dimensional deconvolution of X-ray light curves show the coronae of all these binaries are either in the contact or over-contact configuration, with the primary being 1.7-4 times X-ray brighter than its companion. In the current sample, a minimum of 30\%-50\% of total UV emission is found to originate from the photosphere and positively correlated with the X-ray emission. X-ray spectra of these systems are well explained by two-temperature plasma models. The temperature corresponding to cool and hot components of plasma are found to be in the ranges of 0.25-0.64 and 0.9-1.1 keV, respectively. For the majority of binaries in the sample, the phase-resolved X-ray spectral analysis shows the orbital modulation in X-ray luminosity and emission measure corresponding to the hot component. A total of seven flaring events are also detected in the four systems with the flare energy in the range of (1.95-27.0) × 1033 erg and loop length of the order of 109-11 cm.},

Two flares occurred within roughly one orbital period (Δα ≈ 1.024 P orb) of each other. We analyze the light curve and spectra of the system, and investigate coronal length scales during both quiescence and flares, as well as the timing of the flares.

	abstract = {The theory of binary star formation predicts that close binaries (a {\textless} 100 au) will experience periodic pulsed accretion events as streams of material form at the inner edge of a circumbinary disk (CBD), cross a dynamically cleared gap, and feed circumstellar disks or accrete directly onto the stars. The archetype for the pulsed accretion theory is the eccentric, short-period, classical T Tauri binary DQ Tau. Low-cadence (∼daily) broadband photometry has shown brightening events near most periastron passages, just as numerical simulations would predict for an eccentric binary. Magnetic reconnection events (flares) during the collision of stellar magnetospheres near periastron could, however, produce the same periodic, broadband behavior when observed at a one-day cadence. To reveal the dominant physical mechanism seen in DQ Tau’s low-cadence observations, we have obtained continuous, moderate-cadence, multiband photometry over 10 orbital periods, supplemented with 27 nights of minute-cadence photometry centered on four separate periastron passages. While both accretion and stellar flares are present, the dominant timescale and morphology of brightening events are characteristic of accretion. On average, the mass accretion rate increases by a factor of five near periastron, in good agreement with recent models. Large variability is observed in the morphology and amplitude of accretion events from orbit to orbit. We argue that this is due to the absence of stable circumstellar disks around each star, compounded by inhomogeneities at the inner edge of the CBD and within the accretion streams themselves. Quasiperiodic apastron accretion events are also observed, which are not predicted by binary accretion theory.},

	abstract = {Convection in Earth's fluid core is regarded as a small deviation from a well-mixed adiabatic state of uniform chemical composition. The core is modeled as a binary alloy of iron and some lighter constituent, whose precise chemical composition is unknown but which is here assumed to be FeAd, where Ad = Si, O or S. The turbulent transport of heat and light constituent is considered, and a simple ansatz is proposed in which this is modeled by anisotropic diffusion. On this basis, a closed system of equations and boundary conditions is derived that governs core convection and the geodynamo. The dual (thermal + compositional) nature of core convection is reconsidered. It is concluded that compositional convection may not dominate thermal convection, as had previously been argued by Braginsky (Soviet Phys. Dokl., v. 149, p. 8, 1963; Geomag, and Aeron., v. 4, p. 698, 1964), but that the two mechanisms are most probably comparable in importance. The key parameters leading to this conclusion are isolated and estimated. Their uncertainties, which in some cases are large, are highlighted. The energetics and efficiency of the geodynamo are reconsidered and re-estimated. Arguments are advanced that indicate that the mass fraction of the light constituent in the solid inner core may not be small compared with that in the outer core, e.g. about 60\%. This tends to favor silicon or sulfur over oxygen as the principal light alloying constituent.},

Deciphering why Mercury has such an anomalous field is crucial not only for understanding the internal dynamics, evolutionary history and origin of the planet, but also for establishing the general dynamo theory. Here we present numerical dynamo models, where core convection is driven as thermo-compositional, double-diffusive convection surrounded by a thermally stably stratified layer. We show that the present models produce magnetic fields similar in morphology and strength to that of Mercury. The dynamo-generated fields act on the flow to force interaction between equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric components that results in north-south asymmetric helicity. This symmetry-breaking magnetic feedback causes the flow to generate and maintain Mercury’s axially offset dipolar field.},

However, in the last 30 years the field has been revolutionized by the ability to perform seismic investigations of stellar interiors. This revolution begun with the Sun, where helioseismology has been yielding information competing with what can be inferred about the Earth's interior from geoseismology. The last two decades have witnessed the advent of asteroseismology of solar-like stars, thanks to a dramatic development of new observing facilities providing the first reliable results on the interiors of distant stars. The coming years will see a huge development in this field. In this review we focus on solar-type stars, i.e., cool main-sequence stars where oscillations are stochastically excited by surface convection. After a short introduction and a historical overview of the discipline, we review the observational techniques generally used, and we describe the theory behind stellar oscillations in cool main-sequence stars. We continue with a complete description of the normal mode analyses through which it is possible to extract the physical information about the structure and dynamics of the stars. We then summarize the lessons that we have learned and discuss unsolved issues and questions that are still unanswered.},

	abstract = {We present analytic estimates of the fractional uncertainties on the mass, radius, surface gravity, and density of a transiting planet, using only empirical or semi-empirical measurements. We first express these parameters in terms of transit photometry and radial velocity (RV) observables, as well as the stellar radius R⋆, if required. In agreement with previous results, we find that, assuming a circular orbit, the surface gravity of the planet (gp) depends only on empirical transit and RV parameters, namely the planet period P, the transit depth δ, the RV semi-amplitude K⋆, the transit duration T, and the ingress/egress duration τ. However, the planet mass and density depend on all these quantities, plus R⋆. Thus, an inference about the planet mass, radius, and density must rely upon an external constraint such as the stellar radius. For bright stars, stellar radii can now be measured nearly empirically by using measurements of the stellar bolometric flux, the effective temperature, and the distance to the star via its parallax, with the extinction AV being the only free parameter. For any given system, there is a hierarchy of achievable precisions on the planetary parameters, such that the planetary surface gravity is more accurately measured than the density, which in turn is more accurately measured than the mass. We find that surface gravity provides a strong constraint on the core mass fraction of terrestrial planets. This is useful, given that the surface gravity may be one of the best measured properties of a terrestrial planet.},

During a campaign monitoring the star for possible exoplanet transits, we identified an increase in Sloan i' flux leading to an observed peak at BJD 2457935.996 that was at least 10 per cent over pre-flare flux in this band. It was followed by a two-component rapid decline in the first 100 s that became a slower exponential decay with time constant of 1350 s. A smaller flare event 1300 s after the first added an incremental peak flux increase of 1 per cent of pre-flare flux. Since the onset of the flare was not fully time resolved at a cadence of 62 s, its actual peak value is unknown but greater than the time average over a single exposure of 20 s. The i' band is representative of broad optical and near-IR continuum flux over which the integrated energy of the flare is 100 times the stellar luminosity. This meets the criteria that established the concept of superflares on similar stars. The resulting implied ultraviolet flux and space weather could have had an extreme effect on the atmospheres of planets within the star's otherwise habitable zone.},

	abstract = {We present high-resolution observations of an X10 white-light flare in solar NOAA Active Region 10486 obtained with the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) at the National Solar Observatory/Sacramento Peak on 2003 October 29. Our investigation focuses on flare dynamics observed in the near-infrared (NIR) continuum at 1.56 μm. This is the first report of a white-light flare observed at the opacity minimum. The spatial resolution was close to the diffraction limit of the 76 cm aperture DST. The data benefited from a newly developed high-order adaptive optics system and a state-of-the-art NIR complex metal oxide semiconductor focal plane array. In addition, we compared hard X-ray (HXR) data of RHESSI and magnetograms of the Michelson Doppler Imager on board SOHO with the NIR continuum images. Although it is still possible that some high-energy electrons penetrate deep to this layer, a more likely explanation of the observed emission is back-warming. During the impulsive phase of the flare, two major flare ribbons moved apart, which were both temporally and spatially correlated with RHESSI HXR ribbons. The maximum intensity enhancement of the two flare ribbons is 18\% and 25\%, respectively, compared to the quiet-Sun NIR continuum. The separation speed of the ribbons is about 38 km s-1 in regions with weak magnetic fields and decreases to about 19 km s-1, where stronger magnetic fields are encountered. The derived electric field in reconnection current sheet Ec is of the order of 45 V cm-1 during the flare maximum.},

This emission lasted about half a minute, showing a good time correlation with the peak of the microwave radio flux at 7.58 GHz. The flare can be classified as a type I white-light flare.

SOL2017-09-06T12:00, an X9.3 flare also produced a two-ribbon white light emission across the sunspot detected by Solar Dynamics Orbiter/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. The flare was observed at 212 and 405 GHz with the arcminute-sized beams of the Solar Submillimeter Telescope focal array while making a solar map and at 10 μm, with a 17 arcsec diffraction-limited infrared camera. Images at 10 μm revealed that the sunspot gradually increased in brightness while the event proceeded, reaching a temperature similar to quiet Sun values. From the images we derive a lower bound limit of 180-K flare peak excess brightness temperature or 7,000 sfu if we consider a similar size as the white light source. The rising phase of mid-IR and white light is similar, although the latter decays faster, and the maximum of the mid-IR and white light emission is ∼200 s delayed from the 15.4-GHz peak occurrence. The submillimeter spectrum has a different origin than that of microwaves from 1 to 15 GHz, although it is not possible to draw a definitive conclusion about its emitting mechanism.},

	abstract = {The origin of the near-ultraviolet and optical continuum radiation in flares is critical for understanding particle acceleration and impulsive heating in stellar atmospheres. Radiative-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations in 1D have shown that high energy deposition rates from electron beams produce two flaring layers at T ∼ 104 K that develop in the chromosphere: a cooling condensation (downflowing compression) and heated non-moving (stationary) flare layers just below the condensation. These atmospheres reproduce several observed phenomena in flare spectra, such as the red-wing asymmetry of the emission lines in solar flares and a small Balmer jump ratio in M dwarf flares. The high beam flux simulations are computationally expensive in 1D, and the (human) timescales for completing NLTE models with adaptive grids in 3D will likely be unwieldy for some time to come. We have developed a prescription for predicting the approximate evolved states, continuum optical depth, and emergent continuum flux spectra of RHD model flare atmospheres. These approximate prescriptions are based on an important atmospheric parameter: the column mass (\{m\}\{ref\}) at which hydrogen becomes nearly completely ionized at the depths that are approximately in steady state with the electron beam heating. Using this new modeling approach, we find that high energy flux density ({\textgreater}F11) electron beams are needed to reproduce the brightest observed continuum intensity in IRIS data of the 2014 March 29 X1 solar flare, and that variation in \{m\}\{ref\} from 0.001 to 0.02 g cm-2 reproduces most of the observed range of the optical continuum flux ratios at the peak of M dwarf flares.},

The flare emissions, the first simultaneous observations in two mid-infrared bands at 5.2 and 8.2 μ \{\{m\}\} with white-light and hard X-ray coverage, revealed impulsive time variability with increases on timescales of ∼4 s followed by exponential decay at ∼10 s in two bright regions separated by about 13{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime . The brightest source is compact, unresolved spatially at the diffraction limit (1{\textbackslash}\_{\textbackslash}\_AMP{\textbackslash}\_{\textbackslash}\_farcs;72 at 5.2 μ \{\{m\}\}). We identify the IR sources as flare ribbons also seen in white-light emission at 6173 Å observed by SDO/HMI, with twin hard X-ray sources observed by Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, and with EUV sources (e.g., 94 Å) observed by SDO/AIA. The two infrared points have nearly the same flux density (fν, W m-2 Hz) and extrapolate to a level of about an order of magnitude below that observed in the visible band by HMI, but with a flux of more than two orders of magnitude above the free-free continuum from the hot (∼15 MK) coronal flare loop observed in the X-ray range. The observations suggest that the IR emission is optically thin; this constraint and others suggest major contributions from a density less than about 4× \{10\}13 cm-3. We tentatively interpret this emission mechanism as predominantly free-free emission in a highly ionized but cool and rather dense chromospheric region.},

The prediction of highly impulsive emission means that, on these timescales, the atmospheric hydrodynamics need not be considered in analysing the mid-IR signatures.},

Making maps of the transit signal detection efficiency over the orbital period and planetary radius with light curves of members of four clusters, Hyades, Praesepe, Pleiades, and Upper Scorpius observed by the K2 mission, we evaluate the detectability for the rotation period and modulation semi-amplitude. We find that the detection efficiency remarkably decreases to about 20\% for rapidly rotators with P\_\{rot\} {\textless}= 1 d and the lack of planets in Pleiades is likely due to the high fraction of rapidly rotating M-dwarfs. We also evaluate the improvements of the planet detection with NIR photometry via tests using mock light curves assuming that the signal amplitude of stellar rotation decreases at NIR wavelengths. Our results suggest that NIR photometric monitoring would double relative detection efficiency for transiting planetary candidates with P\_\{rot\} {\textless}= 1 d and find planets around M-dwarfs with approximately 100 Myr missing in the past transit surveys from the space.},

The flare was observed from Proxima Cen on 2019 May 6 as part of a larger multi-wavelength flare monitoring campaign and was captured by Chandra, LCOGT, du Pont, and ALMA. Millimeter emission appears to be a common occurrence in small stellar flares that had gone undetected until recently, making it difficult to interpret these events within the current multi-wavelength picture of the flaring process. The May 6 event is the smallest stellar millimeter flare detected to date. We compare the relationship between the soft X-ray and millimeter emission to that observed in solar flares. The X-ray and optical flare energies of 10\${\textasciicircum}\{30.3{\textbackslash}pm0.2\}\$ and 10\${\textasciicircum}\{28.9{\textbackslash}pm0.1\}\$ erg, respectively, the coronal temperature of T=11.0\${\textbackslash}pm\$2.1 MK, and the emission measure of 9.5\${\textbackslash}pm\$2.2 X 10\${\textasciicircum}\{49\}\$ cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$ are consistent with M-X class solar flares. We find the soft X-ray and millimeter emission during quiescence are consistent with the Gudel-Benz Relation, but not during the flare.

	abstract = {The detection of habitable worlds is one of humanity's greatest endeavors. So far, astrobiological studies show that one of the most critical components for life development is liquid water. Its chemical properties and its capacity to dissolve and hence transport other substances makes this constituent a key piece in the development of life. As a consequence, looking for life as we know it is directly related to the search for liquid water. For a remote detection of life in distant planetary systems, this means looking for planets in the so-called habitable zone. In this sense, K-dwarf stars are the perfect hosts. Contrary to G-dwarfs, the habitable zone is closer, thus making planet detection easier using transit or radial velocity techniques. Contrary to M-dwarfs, the stellar activity is much smaller, hence having a smaller impact in both the detectability and in the true habitability of the planet. Also, K-dwarfs are the quietest in terms of oscillations, and granulation noise. Despite this, there is a dearth of planets in the habitable zone of K-dwarfs due to a lack of observing programs devoted to this parameter space. In response to a call for Legacy Programs of the Calar Alto observatory, we have started the first dedicated and systematic search for habitable planets around K-dwarfs, the K-dwarfs Orbited By habitable Exoplanets (KOBE). This survey is monitoring the radial velocity of 50 carefully pre-selected K-dwarfs with the CARMENES instrument along 5 semesters with an average of 90 data points per target. Based on planet occurrence rates convolved with our detectability limits, we expect to find \$1.68{\textbackslash}pm 0.25\$ planets per star in the KOBE sample and in half of the sample we expect to find one of those planets within the habitable zone. In this paper, we describe the project motivation, goals and target selection and preliminary stellar characterization.},

Each target consists of circular polarization observations covering 7-22 d. For each of the seven targets in which a magnetic field was detected, we reconstructed the magnetic field topology using Zeeman-Doppler imaging. Otherwise, a detection limit has been estimated. Three new epochs of observations of τ Boo are presented, which confirm magnetic polarity reversal. We estimate that the cycle period is 2 yr, but recall that a shorter period of 240 d cannot still be ruled out. The result of our survey is compared to the global picture of stellar magnetic field properties in the mass-rotation diagram. The comparison shows that these giant planet-host stars tend to have similar magnetic field topologies to stars without detected hot Jupiters. This needs to be confirmed with a larger sample of stars.},

The event presents a rare case of a stellar flare observed simultaneously in X-rays (with XMM-Newton) and in optical (with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, TESS). The radiated energy both in the 0.2-12 keV X-ray band (\$1.26 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01 {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{33\}\$ erg) and the bolometric value (\$E\_\{F,bol\} = 5.57 {\textbackslash}pm 0.03 {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{33\}\$ erg) put this event at the lower end of the superflare class. The exceptional photon statistics deriving from the proximity of AD Leo has enabled measurements in the 1-8 AA GOES band for the peak flux (X1445 class) and integrated energy (\$E\_\{F,GOES\} = 4.30 {\textbackslash}pm 0.05 {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}\{32\}\$ erg), making possible a direct comparison with data on flares from our Sun. From extrapolations of empirical relations for solar flares we estimate that a proton flux of at least \$10{\textasciicircum}5{\textbackslash},\{cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} sr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ accompanied the radiative output. With a time lag of 300s between the peak of the TESS white-light flare and the GOES band flare peak as well as a clear Neupert effect this event follows very closely the standard (solar) flare scenario. Time-resolved spectroscopy during the X-ray flare reveals, in addition to the time evolution of plasma temperature and emission measure, a temporary increase of electron density and elemental abundances, and a loop that extends in the corona by 13\% of the stellar radius (\$4 {\textbackslash}cdot 10{\textasciicircum}9\$ cm). Independent estimates of the footprint area of the flare from TESS and XMM-Newton data suggest a high temperature of the optical flare (25000 K), but we consider more likely that the optical and X-ray flare areas represent physically distinct regions in the atmosphere of AD Leo.},

This variability can be periodic, quasi-periodic, or aperiodic. Dipper stars have been discovered in young stellar associations via ground-based and space-based photometric surveys. We present the detection and characterization of the largest collection of dipper stars to date: 293 dipper stars, including 234 new dipper candidates. We have produced a catalog of these targets, which also includes young stellar variables that exhibit predominately bursting-like variability and symmetric variability (equal parts bursting and dipping). The total number of catalog sources is 414. These variable sources were found in a visual survey of TESS light curves, where dipping-like variability was observed. We found a typical age among our dipper sources of {\textless}5 Myr, with the age distribution peaking at {\textasciitilde}2 Myr, and a tail of the distribution extending to ages older than 20 Myr. Regardless of the age, our dipper candidates tend to exhibit infrared excess, which is indicative of the presence of disks. TESS is now observing the ecliptic plane, which is rich in young stellar associations, so we anticipate many more discoveries in the TESS dataset.

We find that \$f\$ remains near unity up to \$t\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}sim 3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$ and drops to almost zero by \$t\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Gyr\}\$, although the trend is less clearly detected for stars with \${\textbackslash}lesssim 0.9{\textbackslash},M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ due to weaker age constraints. This finding is consistent with a view that the detection of rotational modulation is limited by photometric precision to younger stars that exhibit higher-amplitude modulation, and suggests that the detectability of rotational modulation in Kepler light curves is insensitive to metallicity and activity cycles for stars younger than the Sun.},

	abstract = {Eclipsing binaries are important benchmark objects to test and calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. This is especially true for binaries with a fully convective M-dwarf component for which direct measurements of these stars' masses and radii are difficult using other techniques. Within the potential of M-dwarfs to be exoplanet host stars, the accuracy of theoretical predictions of their radius and effective temperature as a function of their mass is an active topic of discussion. Not only the parameters of transiting exoplanets but also the success of future atmospheric characterisation rely on accurate theoretical predictions. We present the analysis of five eclipsing binaries with low-mass stellar companions out of a sub-sample of 23, for which we obtained ultra high-precision light curves using the CHEOPS satellite. The observation of their primary and secondary eclipses are combined with spectroscopic measurements to precisely model the primary parameters and derive the M-dwarfs mass, radius, surface gravity, and effective temperature estimates using the PYCHEOPS data analysis software. Combining these results to the same set of parameters derived from TESS light curves, we find very good agreement (better than 1\% for radius and better than 0.2\% for surface gravity). We also analyse the importance of precise orbits from radial velocity measurements and find them to be crucial to derive M-dwarf radii in a regime below 5\% accuracy. These results add five valuable data points to the mass-radius diagram of fully-convective M-dwarfs.},

The host star TOI-5205 sits near the eponymous `Jao gap', which is the transition region between partially and fully-convective M dwarfs. TOI-5205b has one of the highest mass ratio for M dwarf planets with a mass ratio of almost 0.3\${\textbackslash}\%\$, as it orbits a host star that is just \$0.392 {\textbackslash}pm 0.015\$ \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. Its planetary radius is \$1.03 {\textbackslash}pm 0.03{\textasciitilde}R\_J\$, while the mass is \$1.08 {\textbackslash}pm 0.06{\textasciitilde}M\_J\$. Additionally, the large size of the planet orbiting a small star results in a transit depth of \${\textbackslash}sim 7{\textbackslash}\%\$, making it one of the deepest transits of a confirmed exoplanet orbiting a main-sequence star. The large transit depth makes TOI-5205b a compelling target to probe its atmospheric properties, as a means of tracing the potential formation pathways. While there have been radial velocity-only discoveries of giant planets around mid M dwarfs, this is the first transiting Jupiter with a mass measurement discovered around such a low-mass host star. The high mass of TOI-5205b stretches conventional theories of planet formation and disk scaling relations that cannot easily recreate the conditions required to form such planets.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that the exobase temperature of early terrestrial planetary atmosphere could have reached over 10,000 K. Although such high exobase temperatures should have caused the major gases at the exobase to experience fast Jeans escape, and the entire thermosphere should have experienced hydrodynamic flow, hydrostatic equilibrium was assumed to be valid in this earlier model. In this paper we develop a multicomponent hydrodynamic thermosphere model to self-consistently study the Earth's thermosphere under extreme solar EUV conditions. The model is validated against observations and other models for the present Earth's thermosphere. Simulations show that if forced in hydrostatic equilibrium and maintaining the current composition, the Earth's thermosphere could experience a fast transition to an atmospheric blowoff state when exposed to solar EUV radiation stronger than certain critical flux. When hydrodynamic flow and its associated adiabatic cooling are included, atmospheric blowoff is prevented and Earth's exobase temperature decreases with increasing solar EUV beyond the critical solar EUV flux. Simulations show that the transition of the thermosphere from the hydrostatic equilibrium regime to the hydrodynamic regime occurs when the exobase temperature reaches 7000 to 8000 K if atomic O and N dominate the upper thermosphere. The fast variations of the bulk motion velocities under different exobase temperatures suggest that the adiabatic cooling effect could have kept the exobase temperature lower than {\textasciitilde}1000 K if light gases such as atomic hydrogen were the dominant species in the Earth's thermosphere. We propose that hydrodynamic flow and associated adiabatic cooling should exist in the thermospheres of a broad range of early and/or close-in terrestrial type planets and that the adiabatic cooling effect must be included in the energy balance in order to correctly estimate their thermospheric structures and their evolutionary paths.},

The coupled model is used to investigate the response of the Earth's thermosphere under extreme solar EUV conditions and is compared with previous studies. It is found that (1) the parameterization of Swartz and Nisbet (1972) underestimates the ambient electron heating by photoelectrons significantly in the upper thermosphere of the Earth under conditions with greater than 3 times the present solar EUV irradiance; (2) the transition of the Earth's thermosphere from a hydrostatic equilibrium regime to a hydrodynamic regime occurs at a smaller solar EUV flux condition when enhanced, more realistic, and self-consistent, ambient electron heating by photoelectrons is accounted for; (3) atomic nitrogen becomes the dominant neutral species in the upper thermosphere (competing against atomic oxygen) under extreme solar EUV conditions, and the electron impact processes of atomic nitrogen are important for both the chemistry and energetics in the corresponding thermosphere/ionosphere; (4) N+ remains a minor ion compared to O+, even when atomic nitrogen dominates the exobase; and (5) adiabatic cooling does not play an important role in electron gas energy budget. These findings highlight the importance of an electron transport/energy deposition model when investigating the thermosphere and ionosphere of terrestrial planets in their early evolutionary stages.},

	abstract = {Ultrahot Jupiters represent an exciting avenue for testing extreme physics and observing atmospheric circulation regimes not found in our solar system. Their high temperatures result in thermally ionized particles embedded in atmospheric winds interacting with the planet's interior magnetic field by generating current and experiencing bulk Lorentz force drag. Previous treatments of magnetic drag in 3D general circulation models (GCMs) of ultrahot Jupiters have mostly been uniform drag timescales applied evenly throughout the planet, which neglects the strong spatial dependence of these magnetic effects. In this work, we apply our locally calculated active magnetic drag treatment in a GCM of the planet WASP-76b. We find the effects of this treatment to be most pronounced in the planet's upper atmosphere, where strong differences between the day and night side circulation are present. These circulation effects alter the resulting phase curves by reducing the hot spot offset and increasing the day-night flux contrast. We compare our models to Spitzer phase curves, which imply a magnetic field of at least 3 G for the planet. We additionally contrast our results to uniform drag timescale models. This work highlights the need for more careful treatment of magnetic effects in atmospheric models of hot gas giants.},

In hydrodynamic models, mid-to-high-latitude geostrophic circulations are known to cause a net west-to-east equatorial thermal energy transfer, which drives hotspot offsets eastward. We find that a strong toroidal magnetic field can obstruct these energy transporting circulations. This results in winds aligning with the magnetic field and generates westward Lorentz force accelerations in hotspot regions, ultimately causing westward hotspot offsets. In the subsequent linear analysis we find that this reversal mechanism has an equatorial wave analogy in terms of the planetary-scale equatorial magneto-Rossby waves. We compare our findings to three-dimensional MHD simulations, both quantitatively and qualitatively, identifying the link between the mechanics of magnetically driven hotspot and wind reversals. We use the developed theory to identify physically motivated reversal criteria, which can be used to place constraints on the magnetic fields of ultra-hot Jupiters with observed westward hotspots.},

The equivalent widths of many of these lines show a significant difference between the day-side and night-side of the brown dwarf. This is likely an indication that efficient heat redistribution may not be happening on this object, in agreement with models of hot Jupiter atmospheres. The H α line strength variation shows a strong phase dependency as does the width. We have simulated the Ca II emission lines using a model that includes the brown-dwarf Roche geometry and limb darkening, and we estimate the mass ratio of the system to be 0.135 ± 0.004.

In our previous study, we found that there are difficulties in explaining entire spectra between 1.0 and 5.0 μm with the unified cloudy model (UCM), a brown dwarf atmosphere model. Based on simple radiative equilibrium, temperature in a model atmosphere usually decreases monotonically with height. However, if a brown dwarf has a chromosphere, as inferred by some observations, the temperature in the upper atmosphere is higher. We construct a simple model that takes into account heating owing to chromospheric activity by setting a temperature floor in the upper atmosphere, and find that the model spectra of three brown dwarfs with moderate Hα emission, an indicator of chromospheric activity, are considerably improved to match the AKARI spectra. Because of the higher temperatures in the upper atmosphere, the number of CH4 molecules is reduced, and the absorption band strengths become weaker. The strengths of the absorption bands of H2O and CO also become weaker. On the other hand, other objects with weak Hα emission cannot be fitted with our treatment. We also briefly discuss magnetic heating processes that possibly operate in the upper atmosphere, by extending our numerical simulations for the Sun and stars with surface convection to brown dwarf atmospheres.},

The efficiency of chromospheric heating in the same star ɛ(chr) is typically assumed to be proportional to L(H α)/L bol or L(Ca K)/L bol where the lines H α and Ca K are often the two strongest emission lines in the visible spectrum: the constant of proportionality (η = ɛ(chr)/[L(Hα)/L bol] {\textgreater} 1) includes contributions from many other lines emitted by the chromosphere. In the case of the quiet Sun, it has been known for decades that, in the Sun, the efficiency of chromospheric heating is larger by a factor of ɛ(chr)/ɛ(cor) {\textgreater} 10 than the efficiency of coronal heating. Over the intervening years, data pertaining to ɛ(cor) and ɛ(chr) have been estimated for an increasingly large sample of main-sequence stars with spectral types later than the Sun. These data suggest that among M dwarfs, the efficiency ratio ɛ(chr)/ɛ(cor) may in some stars become smaller than in the solar case. The effect of this is such that the value of ɛ(cor) may become comparable to the value of ɛ(chr). Here, we seek to understand why coronal heating may be {\textgreater}10 times more efficient (relative to chromospheric heating) in certain M dwarfs than in the Sun. Using data on coronal loop properties in flaring stars, we examine the hypothesis that in M dwarfs, the enhanced efficiency of coronal heating may be related to resonant coupling between coronal loops and the source of mechanical energy in the convection zone.},

	abstract = {Context. The substellar triple system VHS J125601.92−125723.9 (hereafter VHS 1256−1257) is composed of an equal-mass M7.5 brown dwarf binary and an L7 low-mass substellar object. In Guirado et al. (2018, A\&amp;A, 610, A23) we published the detection of radio emission at 8.4 GHz coming from the central binary and making it an excellent target for further observations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to identify the origin of the radio emission occurring in the central binary of VHS 1256−1257 while discussing the expected mechanisms involved in the radio emission of ultra-cool dwarfs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We observed this system with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, the European very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) Network, the enhanced Multi-Element Remotely Linked Interferometer Network, the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array, and the Atacama Large Millimetre Array at frequencies ranging from 5 GHz up to 345 GHz in several epochs during 2017, 2018, and 2019. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We found radio emission at 6 GHz and 33 GHz coincident with the expected position of the central binary of VHS 1256−1257. The Stokes I density fluxes detected were 73 ± 4 μJy and 83 ± 13 μJy, respectively, with no detectable circular polarisation or pulses. No emission is detected at higher frequencies (230 GHz and 345 GHz), nor at 5 GHz with VLBI arrays. The emission appears to be stable over almost three years at 6 GHz. To explain the constraints obtained both from the detections and non-detections, we considered multiple scenarios including thermal and nonthermal emission, and different contributions from each component of the binary. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our results can be well explained by nonthermal gyrosynchrotron emission originating at radiation belts with a low plasma density (n{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}e{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 300−700 cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}), a moderate magnetic field strength (B ≈ 140 G), and an energy distribution of electrons following a power-law (dN/dE ∝ E{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−δ{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) with δ fixed at 1.36. These radiation belts would need to be present in both components and also be viewed equatorially.},

	abstract = {We report the results of our analysis of pointed X-ray observations of nearby dMe and dM stars using the position sensitive proportional counter (PSPC) on board the ROSA T satellite (Roentgensatellit). In the cases of those M dwarf stars where PSPC pulse-height distributions of sufficient quality for spectral fitting were obtained, we derive key coronal plasma parameters in order to investigate stellar coronal structure in more detail. In particular, we utilize temperatures and emission measures inferred for one or more distinct components as constraints for the development of semiempirical magnetic loop models as representations of the coronae of low-mass stars. The consistency of these static models as adequate descriptions of the coronae of M dwarfs is then examined. We find that the coronae of low-mass dwarfs consist of two distinct thermal components: a "soft" component with T ∼ 2-4 x 106 K and a "hard" component with T ∼ 107 K. We find that the pulse- height spectra are systematically fitted better with "depleted" abundances compared to solar; the high- temperature emission component on dMe stars appears to contribute a systematically larger fraction of the total flux than the corresponding component in dM stars; and the high-temperature emission component on dMe stars is responsible for most of the observed variation in the count rate. We have modeled the observed temperature components with hydrostatic coronal loop models, and find that: the low-temperature components can be modeled with loops of small size (l ≪ R*) and high pressure (Po ); and the high-temperature components require solutions with either small filling factors ( 0.1), large loops (1 {\textgreater} R*), and high base pressure (P0 ≳ P0sun), or very small filling factors (∼0.1), small loops (1 ≳ R*), and very high pressure (P0 ≫ P0sun)). Based on these observational and model results, we conclude that coronal emission in dMe stars can be interpreted as arising from quiescent active regions (a quiescent, low-temperature component) and compact flaring structures (variable, high- temperature component). Our conclusion that the coronal geometry for low-mass dwarf stars is dominated by a combination of relatively compact, quiescent loop configurations and an unstable flaring component has implications for both stellar dynamo theory and for our understanding of stellar angular momentum evolution. With regard to rotation in late-type stars, which has a direct bearing on dynamo action, we know from observations that the lowest mass stars spin down (via magnetic braking) more slowly than the more nearly solar-type stars. The compact loops we find for the low-temperature component suggests a natural explanation for the observed mass dependence of angular momentum evolution in late-type, main-sequence stars.},

We set out to validate these systems by using a suite of follow-up observations, including adaptive optics, speckle imaging, and reconnaissance spectroscopy. The overlap between C5 with C16 and C18, and C6 with C17, yields light curves with long baselines that allow us to measure the transit ephemeris very precisely, revisit single transit candidates identified in earlier campaigns, and search for additional transiting planets with longer periods not detectable in previous works. Using VESPA, we compute false positive probabilities of less than 1 per cent for 37 candidates orbiting 29 unique host stars and hence statistically validate them as planets. These planets have a typical size of 2.2 R⊕ and orbital periods between 1.99 and 52.71 d. We highlight interesting systems including a sub-Neptune with the longest period detected by K2, sub-Saturns around F stars, several multiplanetary systems in a variety of architectures. These results show that a wealth of planetary systems still remains in the K2 data, some of which can be validated using minimal follow-up observations and taking advantage of analyses presented in previous catalogues.},

We characterize the system using data from the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission, the ESA Gaia mission, ground-based photometry from El Sauce and ASTEP400, and spectroscopy from CHIRON, FEROS, and Veloce. We find that TOI 837 is a T = 9.9 mag G0/F9 dwarf in the southern open cluster IC 2602. The star and planet are therefore \$\{35\}\_\{-5\}{\textasciicircum}\{+11\}\$ million years old. Combining the transit photometry with a prior on the stellar parameters derived from the cluster color-magnitude diagram, we find that the planet has an orbital period of \$8.3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{days\}\$ and is slightly smaller than Jupiter ( \$\{R\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{p\}\}\}=\{0.77\}\_\{-0.07\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.09\}{\textbackslash},\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Jup\}\}\$ ). From radial velocity monitoring, we limit \$\{M\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{p\}\}\}{\textbackslash}sin i\$ to less than 1.20 MJup (3σ). The transits either graze or nearly graze the stellar limb. Grazing transits are a cause for concern, as they are often indicative of astrophysical false-positive scenarios. Our follow-up data show that such scenarios are unlikely. Our combined multicolor photometry, high-resolution imaging, and radial velocities rule out hierarchical eclipsing binary scenarios. Background eclipsing binary scenarios, though limited by speckle imaging, remain a 0.2\% possibility. TOI 837b is therefore a validated adolescent exoplanet. The planetary nature of the system can be confirmed or refuted through observations of the stellar obliquity and the planetary mass. Such observations may also improve our understanding of how the physical and orbital properties of exoplanets change in time.},

Planets that orbit stars in young associations are particularly important because the age of the planetary system is well constrained. We present the discovery of a transiting planet larger than Neptune but smaller than Saturn in the 45 Myr Tucana-Horologium young moving group. The host star is a visual binary, and our follow-up observations demonstrate that the planet orbits the G6V primary component, DS Tuc A (HD 222259A, TIC 410214986). We first identified transits using photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS; alerted as TOI 200.01). We validated the planet and improved the stellar parameters using a suite of new and archival data, including spectra from Southern Astrophysical Research/Goodman, South African Extremely Large Telescope/High Resolution Spectrograph and Las Cumbres Observatories/Network of Robotic Echelle Spectrographs; transit photometry from Spitzer; and deep adaptive optics imaging from Gemini/Gemini Planet Imager. No additional stellar or planetary signals are seen in the data. We measured the planetary parameters by simultaneously modeling the photometry with a transit model and a Gaussian process to account for stellar variability. We determined that the planetary radius is 5.70 ± 0.17 R ⊕ and that the orbital period is 8.1 days. The inclination angles of the host star’s spin axis, the planet’s orbital axis, and the visual binary’s orbital axis are aligned within 15° to within the uncertainties of the relevant data. DS Tuc Ab is bright enough (V = 8.5) for detailed characterization using radial velocities and transmission spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {HAT-P-11 is a mid-K dwarf that hosts one of the first Neptune-sized planets found outside the solar system. The orbit of HAT-P-11b is misaligned with the star’s spin—one of the few known cases of a misaligned planet orbiting a star less massive than the Sun. We find an additional planet in the system based on a decade of precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from Keck/High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. HAT-P-11c is similar to Jupiter in its mass (\{M\}P{\textbackslash}sin i=1.6+/- 0.1 M J ) and orbital period (P=\{9.3\}-0.5+1.0 year), but has a much more eccentric orbit (e = 0.60 ± 0.03). In our joint modeling of RV and stellar activity, we found an activity-induced RV signal of ∼7 \{\{m\}\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1, consistent with other active K dwarfs, but significantly smaller than the 31 \{\{m\}\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}-1 reflex motion due to HAT-P-11c. We investigated the dynamical coupling between HAT-P-11b and c as a possible explanation for HAT-P-11b’s misaligned orbit, finding that planet-planet Kozai interactions cannot tilt planet b’s orbit due to general relativistic precession; however, nodal precession operating on million year timescales is a viable mechanism to explain HAT-P-11b’s high obliquity. This leaves open the question of why HAT-P-11c may have such a tilted orbit. At a distance of 38 pc, the HAT-P-11 system offers rich opportunities for further exoplanet characterization through astrometry and direct imaging.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery of TOI 540 b, a hot planet slightly smaller than Earth orbiting the low-mass star 2MASS J05051443-4756154. The planet has an orbital period of P = 1.239149 days (±170 ms) and a radius of \$r=0.903{\textbackslash}pm 0.052\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus \}\$ , and is likely terrestrial based on the observed mass-radius distribution of small exoplanets at similar insolations. The star is 14.008 pc away and we estimate its mass and radius to be \$M=0.159{\textbackslash}pm 0.014\$ \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ and \$R=0.1895{\textbackslash}pm 0.0079\{R\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ , respectively. The star is distinctive in its very short rotational period of \$\{P\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rot\}\}=17.4264{\textbackslash}pm 0.0094\$ hr and correspondingly small Rossby number of 0.007 as well as its high X-ray-to-bolometric luminosity ratio of \$\{L\}\_\{\{{\textbackslash}rm\{X\}\}\}/\{L\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{bol\}\}=0.0028\$ based on a serendipitous XMM-Newton detection during a slew operation.

TOI 540 b may be an alluring target to study atmospheric erosion due to the strong stellar X-ray emission. It is also among the most accessible targets for transmission and emission spectroscopy and eclipse photometry with the James Webb Space Telescope, and may permit Doppler tomography with high-resolution spectroscopy during transit. This discovery is based on precise photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and ground-based follow-up observations by the MEarth team.},

The planet has a period of ∼175 days and its orbit precesses with a period of only 35 yr. The precession causes the alignment of the orbital planes to vary, and the planet is in a transiting configuration only ∼7\% of the time as seen from Earth. As with several other Kepler circumbinary planets, Kepler-1661 b orbits close to the stability radius, and is near the (hot) edge of the habitable zone. The planet orbits a single-lined, grazing eclipsing binary, containing a 0.84 \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ and 0.26 \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ pair of stars in a mildly eccentric (e = 0.11), 28.2 day orbit. The system is fairly young, with an estimated age of ∼1-3 Gyr, and exhibits significant starspot modulations. The grazing eclipse configuration means the system is very sensitive to changes in the binary inclination, which manifests itself as a change in the eclipse depth. The starspots contaminate the eclipse photometry, but not in the usual way of inducing spurious eclipse timing variations. Rather, the starspots alter the normalization of the light curve, and hence the eclipse depths. This can lead to spurious eclipse depth variations, which are then incorrectly ascribed to binary orbital precession.},

	abstract = {A main goal of NASA's Kepler Mission is to establish the frequency of potentially habitable Earth-size planets (η{\textbackslash}oplus). Relatively few such candidates identified by the mission can be confirmed to be rocky via dynamical measurement of their mass. Here we report an effort to validate 18 of them statistically using the BLENDER technique, by showing that the likelihood they are true planets is far greater than that of a false positive. Our analysis incorporates follow-up observations including high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and information from the analysis of the flux centroids of the Kepler observations themselves. Although many of these candidates have been previously validated by others, the confidence levels reported typically ignore the possibility that the planet may transit a star different from the target along the same line of sight. If that were the case, a planet that appears small enough to be rocky may actually be considerably larger and therefore less interesting from the point of view of habitability. We take this into consideration here and are able to validate 15 of our candidates at a 99.73\% (3σ) significance level or higher, and the other three at a slightly lower confidence. We characterize the GKM host stars using available ground-based observations and provide updated parameters for the planets, with sizes between 0.8 and 2.9 R⊕. Seven of them (KOI-0438.02, 0463.01, 2418.01, 2626.01, 3282.01, 4036.01, and 5856.01) have a better than 50\% chance of being smaller than 2 R⊕ and being in the habitable zone of their host stars.},

We add to these ground-based, HST, and K2 transit-time measurements, and revisit an N-body dynamical analysis of the seven-planet system using our complete set of times from which we refine the mass ratios of the planets to the star. We next carry out a photodynamical analysis of the Spitzer light curves to derive the density of the host star and the planet densities. We find that all seven planets' densities may be described with a single rocky mass-radius relation which is depleted in iron relative to Earth, with Fe 21 wt\% versus 32 wt\% for Earth, and otherwise Earth-like in composition. Alternatively, the planets may have an Earth-like composition but enhanced in light elements, such as a surface water layer or a core-free structure with oxidized iron in the mantle. We measure planet masses to a precision of 3\%-5\%, equivalent to a radial-velocity (RV) precision of 2.5 cm s-1, or two orders of magnitude more precise than current RV capabilities. We find the eccentricities of the planets are very small, the orbits are extremely coplanar, and the system is stable on 10 Myr timescales. We find evidence of infrequent timing outliers, which we cannot explain with an eighth planet; we instead account for the outliers using a robust likelihood function. We forecast JWST timing observations and speculate on possible implications of the planet densities for the formation, migration, and evolution of the planet system.},

Geoelectric amplitudes are estimated for geomagnetic waveforms having 240 s sinusoidal period and amplitudes over 10 min that exceed a once-per-century threshold. As a result of the combination of geographic differences in geomagnetic activity and Earth surface impedance, once-per-century geoelectric amplitudes span more than 2 orders of magnitude and are an intricate function of location. For north-south induction, once-per-century geoelectric amplitudes across large parts of the United States have a median value of 0.26 V/km; for east-west geomagnetic variation the median value is 0.23 V/km. At some locations, once-per-century geoelectric amplitudes exceed 3 V/km.},

Quantifying the maximum possible energy of solar flares of the present-day Sun, if any, is thus a key question in heliophysics. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The largest solar flares observed over the past few decades have reached energies of a few times 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}32{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg, possibly up to 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}33{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg. Flares in active Sun-like stars reach up to about 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}36{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg. In the absence of direct observations of solar flares within this range, complementary methods of investigation are needed to assess the probability of solar flares beyond those in the observational record. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Using historical reports for sunspot and solar active region properties in the photosphere, we scaled to observed solar values a realistic dimensionless 3D MHD simulation for eruptive flares, which originate from a highly sheared bipole. This enabled us to calculate the magnetic fluxes and flare energies in the model in a wide paramater space. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Firstly, commonly observed solar conditions lead to modeled magnetic fluxes and flare energies that are comparable to those estimated from observations. Secondly, we evaluate from observations that 30\% of the area of sunspot groups are typically involved in flares. This is related to the strong fragmentation of these groups, which naturally results from sub-photospheric convection. When the model is scaled to 30\% of the area of the largest sunspot group ever reported, with its peak magnetic field being set to the strongest value ever measured in a sunspot, it produces a flare with a maximum energy of {\textasciitilde}6 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}33{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The results of the model suggest that the Sun is able to produce flares up to about six times as energetic in total solar irradiance fluence as the strongest directly observed flare of Nov. 4, 2003. Sunspot groups larger than historically reported would yield superflares for spot pairs that would exceed tens of degrees in extent. We thus conjecture that superflare-productive Sun-like stars should have a much stronger dynamo than in the Sun.},

And, although such events have only occasionally been observed, through careful analysis of a wealth of space-based and ground-based observations, historical records, and extrapolations from more moderate events, we have developed a basic picture of the components required to produce them. Several key issues, however, remain unresolved. For example, what limits are imposed on the maximum size of such events? What are the likely societal consequences of a so-called "100-year" solar storm? In this review, we summarize our current scientific understanding about extreme space weather events as we follow several examples from the Sun, through the solar corona and inner heliosphere, across the magnetospheric boundary, into the ionosphere and atmosphere, into the Earth's lithosphere, and, finally, its impact on man-made structures and activities, such as spacecraft, GPS signals, radio communication, and the electric power grid. We describe preliminary attempts to provide probabilistic forecasts of extreme space weather phenomena, and we conclude by identifying several key areas that must be addressed if we are better able to understand, and, ultimately, predict extreme space weather events.},

	abstract = {Direct observations of sunspot numbers are available for the past four centuries, but longer time series are required, for example, for the identification of a possible solar influence on climate and for testing models of the solar dynamo. Here we report a reconstruction of the sunspot number covering the past 11,400 years, based on dendrochronologically dated radiocarbon concentrations. We combine physics-based models for each of the processes connecting the radiocarbon concentration with sunspot number. According to our reconstruction, the level of solar activity during the past 70 years is exceptional, and the previous period of equally high activity occurred more than 8,000 years ago. We find that during the past 11,400 years the Sun spent only of the order of 10\% of the time at a similarly high level of magnetic activity and almost all of the earlier high-activity periods were shorter than the present episode. Although the rarity of the current episode of high average sunspot numbers may indicate that the Sun has contributed to the unusual climate change during the twentieth century, we point out that solar variability is unlikely to have been the dominant cause of the strong warming during the past three decades.},

	abstract = {Predicting the solar activity of upcoming cycles is crucial nowadays to anticipate potentially adverse space weather effects on the Earth's environment produced by coronal transients and traveling interplanetary disturbances. The latest advances in deep learning techniques provide new paradigms to obtain effective prediction models that allow to forecast in detail the evolution of cosmogeophysical time series. Because of the underlying complexity of the dynamo mechanism in the solar interior that is at the origin of the solar cycle phenomenon, the predictions offered by state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms represent valuable tools for our understanding of the cycle progression. As a plus, Bayesian deep learning is particularly compelling thanks to recent advances in the field that provide improvements in both accuracy and uncertainty quantification compared to classical techniques. In this work, a deep learning long short-term memory model is employed to predict the complete profile of Solar Cycle 25, thus forecasting also the advent of the next solar minimum. A rigorous uncertainty estimation of the predicted sunspot number is obtained by applying a Bayesian approach. Two different model validation techniques, namely the Train-Test split and the time series k-fold cross-validation, have been implemented and compared, giving compatible results. The forecasted peak amplitude is lower than that of the preceding cycle. Solar Cycle 25 will last 10.6 ± 0.7 yr, reaching its maximum in the middle of the year 2024. The next solar minimum is predicted in 2030 and will be as deep as the previous one.},

	abstract = {Understanding the Sun's magnetic activity is important because of its impact on the Earth's environment. The sunspot record since 1610 shows irregular 11-year cycles of activity; they are modulated on longer timescales and were interrupted by the Maunder minimum in the 17th century. Future behavior cannot easily be predicted – even in the short-term. Recent activity has been abnormally high for at least 8 cycles: is this grand maximum likely to terminate soon or even to be followed by another (Maunder-like) grand minimum? To answer these questions we use, as a measure of the Sun's open magnetic field, a composite record of the solar modulation function Φ, reconstructed principally from the proxy record of cosmogenic 10Be abundances in the GRIP icecore from Greenland. This Φ record extends back for almost 10,000 years, showing many grand maxima and grand minima (defined as intervals when Φ is within the top or bottom 20\% of a Gaussian distribution). We carry out a statistical analysis of this record and calculate the life expectancy of the current grand maximum. We find that it is only expected to last for a further 15–36 years, with the more reliable methods yielding shorter expectancies, and we therefore predict a decline in solar activity within the next two or three cycles. We are not able, however, to predict the level of the ensuing minimum.},

A detailed analysis of the response of the terrestrial magnetosphere has been carried out by studying the extent and shape of the Earth's magnetopause and bow shock over the past four solar cycles. We estimate subsolar stand-off distance of the magnetopause and bow shock and the shape of the magnetopause, using numerical as well as empirical models. The computed magnetopause and bow shock stand-off distances have been found to be increasing steadily since around mid-1990s, consistent with the steady declining trend seen in solar magnetic fields and solar wind microturbulence levels. Similarly, we find an expansion in the shape of the magnetopause since 1996. The implications of the increasing trend seen in the magnetopause and bow shock stand-off distances are discussed and a forecast of the shape of the magnetopause in 2020, the minimum of cycle 24, has been made. Importantly, we also find two instances between 1968 and 1991 when the magnetopause stand-off distance dropped to values close to 6.6 Earth radii, the geostationary orbit, for duration ranging from 9-11 hr and one event in 2005, post 1995 when the decline in photospheric fields began. Though there have been no such events since 2005, it represents a clear and present danger to our satellite systems.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive asteroid threat assessment requires the quantification of both the impact likelihood and resulting consequence across the range of possible events. This paper presents a probabilistic asteroid impact risk (PAIR) assessment model developed for this purpose. The model incorporates published impact frequency rates with state-of-the-art consequence assessment tools, applied within a Monte Carlo framework that generates sets of impact scenarios from uncertain input parameter distributions. Explicit treatment of atmospheric entry is included to produce energy deposition rates that account for the effects of thermal ablation and object fragmentation. These energy deposition rates are used to model the resulting ground damage, and affected populations are computed for the sampled impact locations. The results for each scenario are aggregated into a distribution of potential outcomes that reflect the range of uncertain impact parameters, population densities, and strike probabilities. As an illustration of the utility of the PAIR model, the results are used to address the question of what minimum size asteroid constitutes a threat to the population. To answer this question, complete distributions of results are combined with a hypothetical risk tolerance posture to provide the minimum size, given sets of initial assumptions for objects up to 300 m in diameter. Model outputs demonstrate how such questions can be answered and provide a means for interpreting the effect that input assumptions and uncertainty can have on final risk-based decisions. Model results can be used to prioritize investments to gain knowledge in critical areas or, conversely, to identify areas where additional data have little effect on the metrics of interest.},

They are most probably caused by disintegrating bodies transiting in front of the star. However, the nature of the bodies and obscuration events, such as those observed in KIC 8462852, remain mysterious. A swarm of comets or artificial alien mega-structures have been proposed as an explanation for the latter object. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We explore the possibility that such eclipses are caused by the dust clouds associated with massive parent bodies orbiting the host star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We assumed a massive object and a simple model of the dust cloud surrounding the object. Then, we used the numerical integration to simulate the evolution of the cloud, its parent body, and resulting light-curves as they orbit and transit the star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We found that it is possible to reproduce the basic features in the light-curve of KIC 8462852 with only four objects enshrouded in dust clouds. The fact that they are all on similar orbits and that such models require only a handful of free parameters provides additional support for this hypothesis. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: This model provides an alternative to the comet scenario. With such physical models at hand, at present, there is no need to invoke alien mega-structures for an explanation of these light-curves.},

The object was found serendipitously in the near-IR data obtained by the VISTA Variables in the Vía Láctea (VVV) ESO public survey. Our analysis is based on VVV variability, multicolour, and proper motion (PM) data. Complementary data from the VVV eXtended survey as well as archive data and spectroscopic follow-up observations aided in the analysis and interpretation of VVV-WIT-07. A search for periodicity in the VVV Ks-band light curve of VVV-WIT-07 results in two tentative periods at P ∼ 322 d and P ∼ 170 d. Colours and PM are consistent either with a reddened main-sequence (MS) star or a pre-MS star in the foreground disc. The near-IR spectra of VVV-WIT-07 appear featureless, having no prominent lines in emission or absorption. Features found in the light curve of VVV-WIT-07 are similar to those seen in J1407 (Mamajek's object), a pre-MS K5 dwarf with a ring system eclipsing the star or, alternatively, to KIC 8462852 (Boyajian's star), an F3 IV/V star showing irregular and aperiodic dips in its light curve. Alternative scenarios, none of which is fully consistent with the available data, are also briefly discussed, including a young stellar object, a T Tauri star surrounded by clumpy dust structure, an MS star eclipsed by a nearby extended object, a self-eclipsing R CrB variable star, and even a long-period, high-inclination X-ray binary.},

The dipping activity of the star, discovered during the Kepler mission, presents deep, asymmetric, and aperiodic events. Here we present high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up during some dimming events recorded post-Kepler observations, from ground-based telescopes. We analyse data from the HERMES, HARPS-N, and FIES spectrographs to characterize the stellar atmosphere and to put some constraints on the hypotheses that have appeared in the literature concerning the occulting elements. The star's magnetism, if existing, is not extreme. The spots on the surface, if present, would occupy 0.02 per cent of the area, at most. The chromosphere, irrespective of the epoch of observation, is hotter than the values expected from radiative equilibrium, meaning that the star has some degree of activity. We find no clear evidence of the interstellar medium or exocoments being responsible for the dimmings of the light curve. However, we detect at 1-2σ level, a decrease of the radial velocity of the star during the first dip recorded after the Kepler observations. We claim the presence of an optically thick object with likely inclined and high impact parameter orbits that produces the observed Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.},

The dipping activity can last for between 5 and 80 d. We characterize the object with high-resolution spectroscopy, spectral energy distribution fitting, radial velocity measurements, high-resolution imaging, and Fourier analyses of the Kepler light curve. We determine that KIC 8462852 is a typical main-sequence F3 V star that exhibits no significant IR excess, and has no very close interacting companions. In this paper, we describe various scenarios to explain the dipping events observed in the Kepler light curve. We confirm that the dipping signals in the data are not caused by any instrumental or data processing artefact, and thus are astrophysical in origin. We construct scenario-independent constraints on the size and location of a body in the system that are needed to reproduce the observations. We deliberate over several assorted stellar and circumstellar astrophysical scenarios, most of which have problems explaining the data in hand. By considering the observational constraints on dust clumps in orbit around a normal main-sequence star, we conclude that the scenario most consistent with the data in hand is the passage of a family of exocomet or planetesimal fragments, all of which are associated with a single previous break-up event, possibly caused by tidal disruption or thermal processing. The minimum total mass associated with these fragments likely exceeds 10-6 M⊕, corresponding to an original rocky body of {\textgreater}100 km in diameter. We discuss the necessity of future observations to help interpret the system.},

Recent results by Montet \& Simon lend strength and plausibility to the conclusion of Schaefer that in addition to short-term dimmings, the star also experiences large, secular decreases in brightness on decadal timescales. This, combined with a lack of long-wavelength excess in the star's spectral energy distribution, strongly constrains scenarios involving circumstellar material, including hypotheses invoking a spherical cloud of artifacts. We show that the timings of the deepest dimmings appear consistent with being randomly distributed, and that the star's reddening and narrow sodium absorption is consistent with the total, long-term dimming observed. Following Montet \& Simon's encouragement to generate alternative hypotheses, we attempt to circumscribe the space of possible explanations with a range of plausibilities, including: a cloud in the outer solar system, structure in the interstellar medium (ISM), natural and artificial material orbiting Boyajian's Star, an intervening object with a large disk, and variations in Boyajian's Star itself.

LP 261-75 is a short-period (1.882 day) single-lined system consisting of a mid M-dwarf eclipsed by a probable brown dwarf secondary, with another distant visual brown dwarf companion. LP 991-15 is a long-period (29.3 day) double-lined eclipsing binary on an eccentric orbit with a geometry that produces only primary eclipses.

The system was first identified through a percent-deep transit in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite photometry; further analysis showed it to be a grazing transit of a Jupiter-sized object. Radial velocity (RV) follow-up with the SPIRou near-infrared high-resolution velocimeter and spectropolarimeter in the framework of the 300-night SPIRou Legacy Survey carried out at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope led to the detection of a Keplerian RV signal with a semi-amplitude of 2306 ± 10 m s-1 in phase with the 14.5 day transit period, with a slight but nonzero eccentricity. The intermediate-mass ratio (M⋆/Mcomp {\textasciitilde} 31) is unique for having such a short separation (0.095 ± 0.001 au) among known M-dwarf systems. Interestingly, M-dwarf-BD systems with similar mass ratios exist with separations of tens to thousands of astronomical unit.},

	abstract = {Zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) stars are considered to have enormous starspots and show strong chromospheric emission lines because of their strong surface magnetic field. We discuss the dynamo activities of ZAMS stars with respect to their periodic light variation caused by a starspot and with respect to the strength of the chromospheric emission lines. The light curves of \$33\$ ZAMS stars in IC 2391 and IC 2602 were obtained from {\textbackslash}textit\{TESS\} photometric data. The light curves can be grouped into the following four categories: single frequency, possible shape changer, beater, and complex variability. The amplitudes of the light curves are \$0.001-0.145{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mag\}\$, similar to those of ZAMS stars in Pleiades. The starspot coverages are \$0.1-21{\textbackslash}\%\$. We found that the light variations and Ca{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}emissiontype\{II\} emission line strength of ZAMS stars in IC 2391, IC 2602, and the Pleiades cluster are as large as those of the most active superflare stars and two orders larger than those of the Sun, and are located on the extensions of the superflare stars. These results suggest that superflare stars link the properties of the Sun to those of the ZAMS stars of ages between \$30\$ and \$120{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Myr\}\$. ZAMS stars with a single frequency or possible shape change in the light curve tend to have both large light variation, indicating large spot coverage, and saturated Ca{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}emissiontype\{II\} emission line strength. ZAMS stars with beat or complex variability have small spot coverage and a faint Ca{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}emissiontype\{II\} emission line. We also detected \$21\$ flares in the {\textbackslash}textit\{TESS\} light curves of \$12\$ ZAMS stars in IC 2391 and IC 2602, where most of these stars have saturated chromospheric Ca{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}emissiontype\{II\} emission lines. The energies of the flares are estimated to be \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{33\}-10{\textasciicircum}\{35\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg\}\$, which is comparable with the energy of a superflare.},

	abstract = {With observational efforts moving from the discovery into the characterisation mode, systematic campaigns that cover large ranges of global stellar and planetary parameters will be needed. We aim to uncover cloud formation trends and globally changing chemical regimes due to the host star's effect on the thermodynamic structure of their atmospheres. We aim to provide input for exoplanet missions like JWST, PLATO, and Ariel, as well as potential UV missions ARAGO, PolStar or POLLUX. Pre-calculated 3D GCMs for M, K, G, F host stars are the input for our kinetic cloud model. Gaseous exoplanets fall broadly into three classes: i) cool planets with homogeneous cloud coverage, ii) intermediate temperature planets with asymmetric dayside cloud coverage, and iii) ultra-hot planets without clouds on the dayside. In class ii),\vphantom{\{}\} the dayside cloud patterns are shaped by the wind flow and irradiation. Surface gravity and planetary rotation have little effect. Extended atmosphere profiles suggest the formation of mineral haze in form of metal-oxide clusters (e.g. (TiO2)\_N). The dayside cloud coverage is the tell-tale sign for the different planetary regimes and their resulting weather and climate appearance. Class (i) is representative of planets with a very homogeneous cloud particle size and material compositions across the globe (e.g., HATS-6b, NGTS-1b), classes (ii, e.g., WASP-43b, HD{\textbackslash},209458b) and (iii, e.g., WASP-121b, WP0137b) have a large day/night divergence of the cloud properties. The C/O ratio is, hence, homogeneously affected in class (i), but asymmetrically in class (ii) and (iii). The atmospheres of class (i) and (ii) planets are little affected by thermal ionisation, but class (iii) planets exhibit a deep ionosphere on the dayside. Magnetic coupling will therefore affect different planets differently and will be more efficient on the more extended, cloud-free dayside.},

As survey astronomy continues to grow, the size and complexity of astronomical data bases will increase, and the ability of astronomers to manually scour data and make such discoveries decreases. In this work, we introduce a machine learning-based method to identify anomalies in large data sets to facilitate such discoveries, and apply this method to long cadence light curves from NASA's Kepler Mission. Our method clusters data based on density, identifying anomalies as data that lie outside of dense regions. This work serves as a proof-of-concept case study and we test our method on four quarters of the Kepler long cadence light curves. We use Kepler's most notorious anomaly, Boyajian's star (KIC 8462852), as a rare `ground truth' for testing outlier identification to verify that objects of genuine scientific interest are included among the identified anomalies. We evaluate the method's ability to identify known anomalies by identifying unusual behaviour in Boyajian's star; we report the full list of identified anomalies for these quarters, and present a sample subset of identified outliers that includes unusual phenomena, objects that are rare in the Kepler field, and data artefacts. By identifying {\textless}4 per cent of each quarter as outlying data, we demonstrate that this anomaly detection method can create a more targeted approach in searching for rare and novel phenomena.},

A core part of the BL program is a comprehensive survey of 1702 nearby stars at radio wavelengths (1-10 GHz). Here, we report on observations with the 64 m CSIRO Parkes radio telescope in New South Wales, Australia, and the 100 m Robert C. Byrd Green Bank radio telescope in West Virginia, USA. Over 2016 January to 2019 March, a sample of 1138 stars was observed at Green Bank using the 1.10-1.90 GHz and 1.80-2.80 GHz receivers, and 189 stars were observed with Parkes over 2.60-3.45 GHz. We searched these data for the presence of engineered signals with Doppler-acceleration drift rates between ±4 Hz s-1. Here, we detail our data analysis techniques and provide examples of detected events. After excluding events with characteristics consistent with terrestrial radio interference, we are left with zero candidates. That is, we find no evidence of putative radio transmitters above \$2.1{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ W, and \$9.1{\textbackslash}times \{10\}{\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$ W for Green Bank and Parkes observations, respectively. These observations constitute the most comprehensive search over 1.10-3.45 GHz for technosignatures to date.

Here we present a procedure for the analysis of potential technosignatures, in the context of the ubiquity of human-generated radio interference, which we apply to blc1. Using this procedure, we find that blc1 is not an extraterrestrial technosignature, but rather an electronically drifting intermodulation product of local, time-varying interferers aligned with the observing cadence. We find dozens of instances of radio interference with similar morphologies to blc1 at frequencies harmonically related to common clock oscillators. These complex intermodulation products highlight the necessity for detailed follow-up of any signal of interest using a procedure such as the one outlined in this work.},

We chose the 60 nearest stars, all within 5.1 pc from the Sun. Such nearby stars offer the potential to observe faint radio signals from transmitters that have a power similar to those on Earth. We add a list of 1649 stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalog that span the Hertzprung-Russell diagram, including all spectral types along the main sequence, subgiants, and giant stars. This sample offers diversity and inclusion of all stellar types, but with thoughtful limits and due attention to main sequence stars. Our targets also include 123 nearby galaxies composed of a “morphological-type-complete” sample of the nearest spirals, ellipticals, dwarf spherioidals, and irregulars. While their great distances hamper the detection of technological electromagnetic radiation, galaxies offer the opportunity to observe billions of stars simultaneously and to sample the bright end of the technological luminosity function. We will also use the Green Bank and Parkes telescopes to survey the plane and central bulge of the Milky Way. Finally, the complete target list includes several classes of exotica, including white dwarfs, brown dwarfs, black holes, neutron stars, and asteroids in our solar system.},

	abstract = {A compilation and analysis of the size and frequency of the largest known explosive eruptions on Earth are presented. The ‘largest’ explosive events are defined to be those eruptions yielding greater than 1015 kg of products ({\textgreater}150 times the mass of the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo). This includes all known eruptions with a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) of 8. A total of 47 such events, ranging in age from Ordovician to Pleistocene, are identified, of which 42 eruptions are known from the past 36 Ma. A logarithmic ‘magnitude’ scale of eruption size is applied, based on erupted mass, to these events. On this scale, 46 eruptions {\textgreater}1015 kg are defined to be of magnitude M8. There is one M9 event known so far, the Fish Canyon Tuff, with an erupted mass of {\textgreater}1016 kg and a magnitude of 9.2. Analysis of this dataset indicates that eruptions of size M8 and larger have occurred with a minimum frequency of ≈1.4 events/Ma in two pulses over the past 36 Ma. On the basis of the activity during the past 13.5 Ma, there is at least a 75\% probability of a M8 eruption ({\textgreater}1015 kg) occurring within the next 1 Ma. There is a 1\% chance of an eruption of this scale in the next 460 7,200 years. While the effect of any individual M8 or larger eruption is considerable, the time-averaged impact (i.e., erupted mass×frequency) of the very largest eruptions is small, due to their rarity. The long-term, time-averaged erupted mass flux from magnitude 8 and 9 eruptions is {\textasciitilde}10 100 times less than for M7 eruptions; the time-averaged mass eruption rate from M7 eruptions is 9,500 kg s-1, whereas for M8 and M9 eruptions it is {\textasciitilde}70 1,000 kg s-1. Comparison of the energy release by volcanic eruptions with that due to asteroid impacts suggests that on timescales of {\textless}100,000 years, explosive volcanic eruptions are considerably more frequent than impacts of similar energy yield. This has important implications for understanding the risk of extreme events.},

Only the largest eruptions have a complete record back to the early 19th Century; other important explosive events went unrecorded prior to about 1960. Only a handful of the very biggest eruptions are represented in the geologic record, so it will be impossible to augment historical records post facto. A composite estimate of the magnitude of past explosive eruptions, termed the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), is proposed as a semiquantitative compromise between poor data and the need in various disciplines to evaluate the record of past volcanism. The VEI has been assigned to over 8000 historic and prehistoric eruptions, and a complete list is available in a companion document.},

We model the atmospheric loss process and conclude that GJ 1132 b likely lost the original H/He envelope, suggesting that the atmosphere that we detect has been reestablished. We explore the possibility of H2 mantle degassing, previously identified as a possibility for this planet by theoretical studies, and find that outgassing from ultra-reduced magma could produce the observed atmosphere.

The detection of an atmosphere on this rocky planet raises the possibility that the numerous powerfully irradiated super-Earth planets, believed to be the evaporated cores of sub-Neptunes, may, under favorable circumstances, host detectable atmospheres.},

	abstract = {With recent progress of observational astronomy, the next generation of space telescopes (JWST, ARIEL, OST, HabEx, LUVOIR) will be able to determine the composition of exoplanetary atmospheres in the next decades. The discovery of rocky exoplanets, as potentially favorable harbors for life, finds a particularly strong echo in the scientific community and in the general audience. The interaction of the surface of a planetary body with its atmosphere is key to understanding the composition of the latter and hence to determine whether the planet may host life or not. In an effort to describe surface–atmosphere interactions on rocky planets and the heterogeneous reactions occurring on solid surfaces, in particular mineral dust grains, in such systems it is necessary to develop a systematic approach to this family of reactions. Such an approach is proposed in this Perspective on three very distinct examples of rocky planets: Earth, Mars, and Venus. These bodies have experienced very different evolutions, although they likely started from similar initial conditions; the pressure and temperature of their atmospheres cover a broad range of values, offering an invaluable set of planet-size laboratories to study the impact of physical and chemical parameters on the evolution of atmospheres. Systems that should be investigated in priority with relevance for Earth, Mars, and Venus are discussed. It is shown that a better knowledge of mineral dust supporting heterogeneous reactivity is crucial and that the impact of environmental parameters on these reactions needs to be carefully investigated. Current and future missions to Mars and Venus will require such work to better model and understand the observations. In particular, a strong effort is needed to study Venus, which has only few dedicated laboratory setups although it will be the target of exploration missions in the next decades. These studies will pave the way to build robust models of exoplanetary atmospheres, which will be crucial to account for the observations of their composition by space telescopes in the near future.},

	abstract = {We study predictions of reversals of Earth’s axial magnetic dipole field that are based solely on the dipole’s intensity. The prediction strategy is, roughly, that once the dipole intensity drops below a threshold, then the field will continue to decrease and a reversal (or a major excursion) will occur. We first present a rigorous definition of an intensity threshold-based prediction strategy and then describe a mathematical and numerical framework to investigate its validity and robustness in view of the data being limited. We apply threshold-based predictions to a hierarchy of numerical models, ranging from simple scalar models to 3-D geodynamos. We find that the skill of threshold-based predictions varies across the model hierarchy. The differences in skill can be explained by differences in how reversals occur: if the field decreases towards a reversal slowly (in a sense made precise in this paper), the skill is high, and if the field decreases quickly, the skill is low. Such a property could be used as an additional criterion to identify which models qualify as Earth-like. Applying threshold-based predictions to Virtual Axial Dipole Moment palaeomagnetic reconstructions (PADM2M and Sint-2000) covering the last two million years, reveals a moderate skill of threshold-based predictions for Earth’s dynamo. Besides all of their limitations, threshold-based predictions suggests that no reversal is to be expected within the next 10 kyr. Most importantly, however, we show that considering an intensity threshold for identifying upcoming reversals is intrinsically limited by the dynamic behaviour of Earth’s magnetic field.},

Our approach is essentially empirical, based on the eruptions recorded in the LaMEVE database. It differs from previous approaches mainly in our conservative treatment of magnitude-rounding and under-recording. Our estimate for the return period of 'super-eruptions' (1000Gt, or M8) is 17ka (95\% CI: 5.2ka, 48ka), which is substantially shorter than previous estimates, indicating that volcanoes pose a larger risk to human civilisation than previously thought.},

We expect to observe a wide variety of atmospheres and planets with alternative evolutionary paths, with some planets resembling Earth at different epochs. For an Earth-like atmospheric time trajectory, we simulate planets from the prebiotic to the current atmosphere based on geological data. We use a stellar grid F0V to M8V (\{T\}\{eff\}=7000-2400 K) to model four geological epochs of Earth's history corresponding to a prebiotic world (3.9 Ga), the rise of oxygen at 2.0 Ga and at 0.8 Ga, and the modern Earth. We show the VIS-IR spectral features, with a focus on biosignatures through geological time for this grid of Sun-like host stars and the effect of clouds on their spectra. We find that the observability of biosignature gases reduces with increasing cloud cover and increases with planetary age. The observability of the visible O2 feature for lower concentrations will partly depend on clouds, which, while slightly reducing the feature, increase the overall reflectivity, and thus the detectable flux of a planet. The depth of the IR ozone feature contributes substantially to the opacity at lower oxygen concentrations, especially for the high near-UV stellar environments around F stars. Our results are a grid of model spectra for atmospheres representative of Earth's geological history to inform future observations and instrument design and are available online at http://carlsaganinstitute.org/data/.},

We introduce a method, called Altruistic Yield Optimization, that optimizes the target list and exposure times to maximize mission yield, adapts maximally to changes in mission parameters, and increases exoEarth candidate yield by up to 100\% compared to previous methods. We use Altruistic Yield Optimization to estimate exoEarth candidate yield for a large suite of mission and astrophysical parameters using single visit completeness.

Recent efforts to increase the estimated yields, by creating observation plans optimized for the detection and characterization of Earth-twins, have focused solely on coronagraphic instruments; starshade-based missions could benefit from a similar analysis. Here we explore how to prioritize observations for a starshade given the limiting resources of both fuel and time, present analytic expressions to estimate fuel use, and provide efficient numerical techniques for maximizing the yield of starshades. We implemented these techniques to create an approximate design reference mission code for starshades and used this code to investigate how exoEarth candidate yield responds to changes in mission, instrument, and astrophysical parameters for missions with a single starshade. We find that a starshade mission operates most efficiently somewhere between the fuel- and exposuretime-limited regimes and, as a result, is less sensitive to photometric noise sources as well as parameters controlling the photon collection rate in comparison to a coronagraph. We produced optimistic yield curves for starshades, assuming our optimized observation plans are schedulable and future starshades are not thrust-limited. Given these yield curves, detecting and characterizing several dozen exoEarth candidates requires either multiple starshades or an η≳0.3.},

We define an Earth twin as any exoplanet within half an e-folding of 1 au in semimajor axis and 1 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus in planetary radius, orbiting a G-dwarf. Using Monte Carlo analyses, we quantify the biases and planetary false-positive rates of Earth searches. That is, given a pale dot at the correct projected separation and brightness to be a candidate Earth, what are the odds that it is, in fact, an Earth twin? Our notional telescope has a diameter of 10 m, an inner working angle of 3λ/D, and an outer working angle of 10λ/D (62 mas and 206 mas at 1.0 μm). With no precursor knowledge and one visit per star, 77\% of detected candidate Earths are actually un-Earths; their mean radius is 2.3 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus , a sub-Neptune. The odds improve if we image every planet at its optimal orbital phase, either by relying on precursor knowledge, or by performing multi-epoch direct imaging. In such a targeted search, 47\% of detected Earth twin candidates are false positives, and they have a mean radius of 1.7 \{R\}{\textbackslash}oplus .

	abstract = {We provide estimates of volcanism versus time for planets with Earth-like composition and masses 0.25-25 M ⊕, as a step toward predicting atmospheric mass on extrasolar rocky planets. Volcanism requires melting of the silicate mantle. We use a thermal evolution model, calibrated against Earth, in combination with standard melting models, to explore the dependence of convection-driven decompression mantle melting on planet mass. We show that (1) volcanism is likely to proceed on massive planets with plate tectonics over the main-sequence lifetime of the parent star; (2) crustal thickness (and melting rate normalized to planet mass) is weakly dependent on planet mass; (3) stagnant lid planets live fast (they have higher rates of melting than their plate tectonic counterparts early in their thermal evolution), but die young (melting shuts down after a few Gyr); (4) plate tectonics may not operate on high-mass planets because of the production of buoyant crust which is difficult to subduct; and (5) melting is necessary but insufficient for efficient volcanic degassing—volatiles partition into the earliest, deepest melts, which may be denser than the residue and sink to the base of the mantle on young, massive planets. Magma must also crystallize at or near the surface, and the pressure of overlying volatiles must be fairly low, if volatiles are to reach the surface. If volcanism is detected in the 10 Gyr-old τ Ceti system, and tidal forcing can be shown to be weak, this would be evidence for plate tectonics.},

	abstract = {Like the planets and moons in our solar system, the surfaces of terrestrial exoplanets may be shaped by volcanic activity. The magnitudes and rates of volcanic activity on terrestrial exoplanets will be intimately linked to their sizes and internal heating rates and can either facilitate or preclude the existence of habitable environments. In order to place bounds on the potential for such activity, we estimate total internal heating rates for 53 exoplanets with masses and radii up to ∼8M⊕ and 2R⊕, respectively, assuming that internal heating is drawn from both radiogenic and tidal sources. We then compare these internal heating rates to those of the planets and moons in our solar system in an attempt to constrain the expected rates of volcanic activity on these extrasolar worlds. We find that all 53 of the exoplanets surveyed are likely to have volcanic activity at their surfaces, and that at least 26\% of these planets may be extrasolar ocean worlds. The majority of these ocean worlds may be similar in structure to the icy moons of the giant planets, having internal oceans beneath layers of surface ice. If so, these planets may exhibit cryovolcanism (i.e., icy volcanism) at their surfaces. Recent studies have shown that extrasolar volcanism could be detected by high-resolution spectrographs on existing ground-based telescopes. In the case of planets with densities and/or effective temperatures that are consistent with H2O-rich compositions, spectral identification of excess water vapor and other molecules that are explosively vented into space during cryovolcanic eruptions could serve as a way to infer the presence of subsurface oceans, and therefore indirectly assess their habitability. Considering the implications for habitability, our results suggest that continued characterization of terrestrial exoplanets in terms of their potential for volcanic activity should be a priority in the coming years.},

We calculate the observation time needed to detect explosive volcanism on exoplanets in primary as well as secondary eclipse and discuss the likelihood of observing volcanism on transiting Earth-sized to super-Earth-sized exoplanets. We find that sulfur dioxide from large explosive eruptions does present a spectral signal that is remotely detectable especially for secondary eclipse measurements around the closest stars and ground-based telescopes, and report the frequency and magnitude of the expected signatures. The transit probability of a planet in the habitable zone decreases with distance from the host star, making small, nearby host stars the best targets.},

The primary star LTT 1445A (0.257 M ⊙) is known to host the transiting planet LTT 1445Ab with an orbital period of 5.36 days, making it the second-closest known transiting exoplanet system, and the closest one for which the host is an M dwarf. Using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite data, we present the discovery of a second planet in the LTT 1445 system, with an orbital period of 3.12 days. We combine radial-velocity measurements obtained from the five spectrographs, Echelle Spectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations, High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher, High-Resolution Echelle Spectrometer, MAROON-X, and Planet Finder Spectrograph to establish that the new world also orbits LTT 1445A. We determine the mass and radius of LTT 1445Ab to be 2.87 ± 0.25 M ⊕ and \$\{1.304\}\_\{-0.060\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.067\}\$ R ⊕, consistent with an Earth-like composition. For the newly discovered LTT 1445Ac, we measure a mass of \$\{1.54\}\_\{-0.19\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.20\}\$ M ⊕ and a minimum radius of 1.15 R ⊕, but we cannot determine the radius directly as the signal-to-noise ratio of our light curve permits both grazing and nongrazing configurations. Using MEarth photometry and ground-based spectroscopy, we establish that star C (0.161 M ⊙) is likely the source of the 1.4 day rotation period, and star B (0.215 M ⊙) has a likely rotation period of 6.7 days. We estimate a probable rotation period of 85 days for LTT 1445A. Thus, this triple M-dwarf system appears to be in a special evolutionary stage where the most massive M dwarf has spun down, the intermediate mass M dwarf is in the process of spinning down, while the least massive stellar component has not yet begun to spin down.},

	abstract = {Variability in the light curves of spotted, rotating stars is often non-sinusoidal and quasi-periodic - spots move on the stellar surface and have finite lifetimes, causing stellar flux variations to slowly shift in phase. A strictly periodic sinusoid therefore cannot accurately model a rotationally modulated stellar light curve. Physical models of stellar surfaces have many drawbacks preventing effective inference, such as highly degenerate or high-dimensional parameter spaces. In this work, we test an appropriate effective model: a Gaussian Process with a quasi-periodic covariance kernel function. This highly flexible model allows sampling of the posterior probability density function of the periodic parameter, marginalizing over the other kernel hyperparameters using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. To test the effectiveness of this method, we infer rotation periods from 333 simulated stellar light curves, demonstrating that the Gaussian process method produces periods that are more accurate than both a sine-fitting periodogram and an autocorrelation function method. We also demonstrate that it works well on real data, by inferring rotation periods for 275 Kepler stars with previously measured periods. We provide a table of rotation periods for these and many more, altogether 1102 Kepler objects of interest, and their posterior probability density function samples. Because this method delivers posterior probability density functions, it will enable hierarchical studies involving stellar rotation, particularly those involving population modelling, such as inferring stellar ages, obliquities in exoplanet systems, or characterizing star-planet interactions. The code used to implement this method is available online.},

	abstract = {Context. The Kepler space telescope monitors more than 160 000 stars with an unprecedented precision providing the opportunity to study the rotation of thousands of stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present rotation periods for thousands of active stars in the Kepler field derived from Q3 data. In most cases a second period close to the rotation period was detected that we interpreted as surface differential rotation (DR). We show how the absolute and relative shear (ΔΩ and α = ΔΩ/Ω, respectively) correlate with rotation period and effective temperature. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Active stars were selected from the whole sample using the range of the variability amplitude. To detect different periods in the light curves we used the Lomb-Scargle periodogram in a pre-whitening approach to achieve parameters for a global sine fit. The most dominant periods from the fit were associated to different surface rotation periods. Our purely mathematical approach is capable of detecting different periods but cannot distinguish between the physical origins of periodicity. We ascribe the existence of different periods to DR, but spot evolution could also play a role. Because of the large number of stars the period errors are estimated statistically. We thus cannot exclude the existence of false positives among our periods. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: In our sample of 40 661 active stars we found 24 124 rotation periods P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} between 0.5 and 45 days, with a mean of ⟨P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}⟩ = 16.3 days. The distribution of stars with 0.5 \&lt; B - V \&lt; 1.0 and ages derived from angular momentum evolution that are younger than 300 Myr is consistent with a constant star-formation rate; the detection among older stars is incomplete probably because of our active sample selection. A second period P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} within ±30\% of the rotation period P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} was found in 18 616 stars (77.2\%). Attributing these two periods to DR we found that for active stars other than the Sun the relative shear α increases with rotation period, and slightly decreases with effective temperature. The absolute shear ΔΩ slightly increases from ΔΩ = 0.079 rad d{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 3500 K to ΔΩ = 0.096 rad d{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 6000 K. Above 6000 K, ΔΩ shows much larger scatter. The dependence of ΔΩ on rotation period is weak over a large period range. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Latitudinal differential rotation measured for the first time in more than 18 000 stars provides a comprehensive picture of stellar surface shear. This picture is consistent with major predictions from mean-field theory, and seems to support these models.

For a magnitude-limited sample that comprises 960 of the 1305 stars, our Keck-HIRES spectra have a median signal-to-noise ratio of 45 per pixel at ∼6700 Å with spectral resolution {\textbackslash}tfrac\{λ \}\{\{\{Δ \}\}λ \} = R = 55,000. We identify 80 young stars that have A(Li) values greater than the Hyades at their respective effective temperatures; these stars are younger than ∼650 Myr, the approximate age of the Hyades. We then compare the distribution of A(Li) with planet size, multiplicity, orbital period, and insolation flux. We find larger planets preferentially in younger systems, with an A-D two-sided test p-value = 0.002, a {\textgreater} 3σ confidence that the older and younger planet samples do not come from the same parent distribution. This is consistent with planet inflation/photoevaporation at early ages. The other planet parameters (Kepler planet multiplicity, orbital period, and insolation flux) are uncorrelated with age.

	abstract = {Context. In addition to the discovery of hundreds of exoplanets, the high-precision photometry from the CoRoT and Kepler satellites has led to measurements of surface rotation periods for tens of thousands of stars, which can potentially be used to infer stellar ages via gyrochronology. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Our main goal is to derive ages of thousands of field stars using consistent rotation period measurements derived by different methods. Multiple rotation periods are interpreted as surface differential rotation (DR). We study the dependence of DR with rotation period and effective temperature. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We reanalyze a previously studied sample of 24 124 Kepler stars using different approaches based on the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. Each quarter (Q1-Q14) is treated individually using a prewhitening approach. Additionally, the full time series and their different segments are analyzed. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: For more than 18 500 stars our results are consistent with the rotation periods from McQuillan et al. (2014, ApJS, 211, 24). Of these, more than 12 300 stars show multiple significant peaks, which we interpret as DR. Dependencies of the DR with rotation period and effective temperature could be confirmed, e.g., the relative DR increases with rotation period. Gyrochronology ages between 100 Myr and 10 Gyr were derived for more than 17 000 stars using different gyrochronology relations, most of them with uncertainties dominated by period variations. We find a bimodal age distribution for T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} between 3200-4700 K. The derived ages reveal an empirical activity-age relation using photometric variability as stellar activity proxy. Additionally, we found 1079 stars with extremely stable (mostly short) periods. Half of these periods may be associated with rotation stabilized by non-eclipsing companions, the other half might be due to pulsations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The derived gyrochronology ages are well constrained since more than {\textasciitilde}93.0\% of the stars seem to be younger than the Sun where calibration is most reliable. Explaining the bimodality in the age distribution is challenging, and limits accurate stellar age predictions. The relation between activity and age is interesting, and requires further investigation. The existence of cool stars with almost constant rotation period over more than three years of observation might be explained by synchronization with stellar companions, or a dynamo mechanism keeping the spot configurations extremely stable. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Tables 2 and 4 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/583/A65"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/583/A65{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

For this, we consider an optical telescope, placed in the image plane that forms in the strong interference region of the SGL. We consider an Earth-like exoplanet located in our immediate stellar neighborhood and model its characteristics using our own Earth. We estimate photon fluxes from such a compact, extended, resolved exoplanet. This light appears in the form of an Einstein ring around the Sun, seen through the solar corona. The solar corona background contributes a significant amount of stochastic noise and represents the main noise source for observations utilizing the SGL. We estimate the magnitude of this noise. We compute the resulting signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and related integration times that are needed to perform imaging measurements under realistic conditions. It is known that deconvolution, removing the blur due to the SGL's spherical aberration substantially decreases the SNR. Our key finding is that this "penalty" is significantly mitigated when sampling locations in the image plane (image pixels) remain widely spaced. Consequently, we conclude that an imaging mission is challenging but feasible, using technologies that are either already available or in active development. Under realistic conditions, high-resolution imaging of Earth-like exoplanets in our galactic neighborhood requires only weeks or months of integration time, not years as previously thought: a high quality 1000 × 1000 pixel image of an Earth-like planet at Proxima Centauri could be obtained with SNR{\textgreater}10 using approximately 14 months of integration time.},

The mission goal is to conduct exoplanet imaging operations at heliocentric distances in the range {\textasciitilde}548-900 astronomical units (AU). Starting at 548 AU from the Sun, light from an exoplanet located behind the Sun is greatly amplified by the SGL. The objective is to capture this light and use it for multipixel imaging of an exoplanet up to 100 light years distant. Using a meter-class telescope one can produce images of the exoplanet with a surface resolution measured in tens of kilometers and to identify signs of habitability. The data are acquired pixel-by-pixel while moving an imaging spacecraft within the image. Given the long duration of the mission, decades to 900 AU, we address an architecture for the fastest possible transit time while reducing mission risk and overall cost. The mission architecture implements solar sailing technologies and in-space aggregation of modularized functional units to form mission capable spacecraft. The study reveals elements of such a challenging mission, but it is nevertheless found to be feasible with technologies that are either extant or in active development.},

	abstract = {We consider the optical properties of the solar gravitational lens (SGL) treating the Sun as a massive compact body. Using our previously developed wave-optical treatment of the SGL, we convolve it with a thin-lens representing an optical telescope, and estimate the power spectral density and associated photon flux at individual pixel locations on the image sensor at the focal plane of the telescope. We also consider the solar corona, which is the dominant noise source when imaging faint objects with the SGL. We evaluate the signal-to-noise ratio at individual pixels as a function of wavelength. To block out the solar light, we contrast the use of a conventional internal coronagraph with a Lyot-stop to an external occulter (i.e., starshade). An external occulter, not being a subject to the diffraction limit of the observing telescope, makes it possible to use small telescopes (e.g., \${\textbackslash}sim 40\${\textasciitilde}cm) for spatially and spectrally resolved imaging with the SGL in a broad range of wavelengths from optical to mid-infrared (IR) and without the substantial loss of optical throughput that is characteristic to internal devices. Mid-IR observations are especially interesting as planets are self-luminous at these wavelengths, producing a strong signal, while there is significantly less noise from the solar corona. This part of the spectrum contains numerous features of interest for exobiology and biosignature detection. We develop tools that may be used to estimate instrument requirements and devise optimal observing strategies to use the SGL for high-resolution, spectrally resolved imaging, ultimately improving our ability to confirm and study the presence of life on a distant world.},

	abstract = {We examined the solar gravitational lens (SGL) as the means to produce direct high-resolution, multipixel images of exoplanets. The properties of the SGL are remarkable: it offers maximum light amplification of {\textasciitilde}1e11 and angular resolution of {\textasciitilde}1e-10 arcsec. A probe with a 1-m telescope in the SGL focal region can image an exoplanet at 30 pc with 10-kilometer resolution on its surface, sufficient to observe seasonal changes, oceans, continents, surface topography. We reached and exceeded all objectives set for our study: We developed a new wave-optical approach to study the imaging of exoplanets while treating them as extended, resolved, faint sources at large but finite distances. We properly accounted for the solar corona brightness. We developed deconvolution algorithms and demonstrated the feasibility of high-quality image reconstruction under realistic conditions. We have proven that multipixel imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets with the SGL are feasible. We have developed a new mission concept that delivers an array of optical telescopes to the SGL focal region relying on three innovations: i) a new way to enable direct exoplanet imaging, ii) use of smallsats solar sails fast transit through the solar system and beyond, iii) an open architecture to take advantage of swarm technology. This approach enables entirely new missions, providing a great leap in capabilities for NASA and the greater aerospace community. Our results are encouraging as they lead to a realistic design for a mission that will be able to make direct resolved images of exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood. It could allow exploration of exoplanets relying on the SGL capabilities decades, if not centuries, earlier than possible with other extant technologies. The architecture and mission concepts for a mission to the strong interference region of the SGL are promising and should be explored further.},

An imaging telescope, modeled as a convex lens, is positioned within the image cylinder formed by the light received from the source. In the strong interference region of the SGL, this light is greatly amplified, forming the Einstein ring around the Sun, representing a distorted image of the extended source. We study the intensity distribution within the Einstein ring observed in the focal plane of the convex lens. For any particular telescope position in the image plane, we model light received from the resolved source as a combination of two signals: light received from the directly imaged region of the source and light from the rest of the source. We also consider the case when the telescope points away from the extended source or, equivalently, it observes light from sources in sky positions that are some distance away from the extended source but still in its proximity. At even larger distances from the optical axis, in the weak interference or geometric optics regions, our approach recovers known models related to microlensing but now obtained via the wave-optical treatment. We then derive the power of the signal and related photon fluxes within the annulus that contains the Einstein ring of the extended source, as seen by the imaging telescope. We discuss the properties of the deconvolution process, especially its effects on noise in the recovered image. We compare anticipated signals from realistic exoplanetary targets against estimates of noise from the solar corona and estimate integration times needed for the recovery of high-quality images of faint sources.

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220807415P},
	abstract = {Abridged. We observed the 40 Myr old star DS Tuc A with XMM-Newton and recorded two X-ray bright flares, with the second event occurring about 12 ks after the first one. Their duration from the rise to the end of the decay was of about 8-10 ks in soft X-rays (0.3-10 keV). The flares were also recorded in the band 200-300 nm with the UVM2 filter of the Optical Monitor. The duration of the flares in UV was about 3 ks. The observed delay between the peak in the UV band and in X-rays is a probe of the heating phase followed by the evaporation and increase of density and emission measure of the flaring loop. The coronal plasma temperature at the two flare peaks reached 54-55 MK. The diagnostics based on temperatures and time scales of the flares applied to these two events allow us to infer a loop length of 5-7 x 10{\textasciicircum}10 cm, which is about the size of the stellar radius. We also infer values of electron density at the flare peaks of 2.3-6.5 x 10{\textasciicircum}11 cm{\textasciicircum}-3 , and a minimum magnetic field strength of order of 300-500 G needed to confine the plasma. The energy released during the flares was of order of 5-8 x 10{\textasciicircum}34 erg in the band 0.3-10 keV and 0.9-2.7 x 10{\textasciicircum}33 erg in the UV band (200-300 nm). We speculate that the flares were associated with Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) that hit the planet about 3.3 hr after the flares and dramatically increasing the rate of evaporation of the planet. From the RGS spectra we retrieved the emission measure distribution and the abundances of coronal metals during the quiescent and the flaring states. In agreement with what inferred from time resolved spectroscopy and EPIC spectra, also from the analysis of RGS spectra during the flares we infer a high electron density.},

	abstract = {Multi-planet systems orbiting M dwarfs provide valuable tests of theories of small planet formation and evolution. K2-3 is an early M dwarf hosting three small exoplanets (1.5-2.0 Earth radii) at distances of 0.07-0.20 AU. We measure the high-energy spectrum of K2-3 with HST/COS and XMM-Newton, and use empirically-driven estimates of Ly-alpha and extreme ultraviolet flux. We use EXOFASTv2 to jointly fit radial velocity, transit, and SED data. This constrains the K2-3 planet radii to 4\% uncertainty and the masses of K2-3b and c to 13\% and 30\%, respectively; K2-3d is not detected in RV measurements. K2-3b and c are consistent with rocky cores surrounded by solar composition envelopes (mass fractions of 0.36\% and 0.07\%), H2O envelopes (55\% and 16\%), or a mixture of both. However, based on the high-energy output and estimated age of K2-3, it is unlikely that K2-3b and c retain solar composition atmospheres. We pass the planet parameters and high-energy stellar spectrum to atmospheric models. Dialing the high-energy spectrum up and down by a factor of 10 produces significant changes in trace molecule abundances, but not at a level detectable with transmission spectroscopy. Though the K2-3 planets span the small planet radius valley, the observed system architecture cannot be readily explained by photoevaporation or core-powered mass loss. We instead propose 1) the K2-3 planets are all volatile-rich, with K2-3d having a lower density than typical of super-Earths, and/or 2) the K2-3 planet architecture results from more stochastic processes such as planet formation, planet migration, and impact erosion.},

We use X-Shooter observations of a sample of 107 young stars in the Lupus (1-3 Myr) and Upper Scorpius (5-10 Myr) star-forming regions to search for correlations between the line properties, as well as the disk inclination and accretion luminosity. We identified eight distinct profile types in the sample. We fitted Gaussian curves to the line features to measure the maximum velocities traced in absorption, the full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of the line features, and the Gaussian area of the features. We compare the proportion of each profile type in our sample to previous studies in Taurus. We find significant variations between Taurus and Lupus in the proportion of P Cygni and inverse P Cygni profiles, and between Lupus and Upper Scorpius in the number of emission-only and combination profile types. We find that the blue-shifted absorption features appear less blue-shifted at disk inclinations close to edge-on, but no such trend with inclination is observed in sources with only red-shifted features. Higher accretion rates were observed in sources with strong blue-shifted features which, along with the changes in the proportions of each profile type observed in the two regions, indicates that younger sources may drive stronger jets or winds. Overall, we observe variations in the proportion of each profile type and in the line properties which indicates and evolution of accretion and ejection signatures over time, and with source properties. These results confirm past works and models of the He I line, but for a larger sample and for multiple star-forming regions. The work highlights the power of the He I line as a probe of the gas in the innermost regions of the disk.},

These observations of Betelgeuse reveal that a substantial surface mass ejection (SME) occurred and moved out through the extended atmosphere of the supergiant. A photospheric shock occurred in 2019 January - March, progressed through the extended atmosphere of the star during the following 11 months and led to dust production in the atmosphere. Resulting from the substantial mass outflow, the stellar photosphere was left with lower temperatures and the chromosphere with a lower density. The mass ejected could represent a significant fraction of the total annual mass loss rate from the star suggesting that episodic mass loss events can contribute an amount comparable to that of the stellar wind. Following the SME, Betelgeuse was left with a cooler average photosphere, an unusual short photometric oscillation, reduced velocity excursions, and the disappearance of the \${\textbackslash}sim\$400-day pulsation in the optical and radial velocity for more than two years following the Great Dimming.},

The analysis of the occurrence rate of powerful solar X-ray flares of class M and X and superflares on stars shows that, with allowance for the difference in the spottedness and compactness of active regions, both sets can be described by a single model. Thus, the problem of superflares on stars and their absence on the Sun is reduced to the problem of difference in the effectiveness of the dynamo mechanisms.},

	abstract = {The Kepler and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) missions have generated over 100,000 potential transit signals that must be processed in order to create a catalog of planet candidates. During the past few years, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning to analyze these data in search of new exoplanets. Different from the existing machine learning works, ExoMiner, the proposed deep learning classifier in this work, mimics how domain experts examine diagnostic tests to vet a transit signal. ExoMiner is a highly accurate, explainable, and robust classifier that (1) allows us to validate 301 new exoplanets from the MAST Kepler Archive and (2) is general enough to be applied across missions such as the ongoing TESS mission. We perform an extensive experimental study to verify that ExoMiner is more reliable and accurate than the existing transit signal classifiers in terms of different classification and ranking metrics. For example, for a fixed precision value of 99\%, ExoMiner retrieves 93.6\% of all exoplanets in the test set (i.e., recall = 0.936), while this rate is 76.3\% for the best existing classifier. Furthermore, the modular design of ExoMiner favors its explainability. We introduce a simple explainability framework that provides experts with feedback on why ExoMiner classifies a transit signal into a specific class label (e.g., planet candidate or not planet candidate).},

By providing homogeneous data sets with a high signal-to-noise ratio and wide wavelength coverage, Ariel will unveil the atmospheric demographics of these faraway worlds, helping to constrain planet formation and evolution processes on a galactic scale. Ariel seeks to undertake a statistical survey of a diverse population of planets; therefore, the sample of planets from which this selection can be made is of the utmost importance. While many suitable targets have already been found, hundreds more will be discovered before the mission is operational. Previous studies have used predictions of exoplanet detections to forecast the available planet population by the launch date of Ariel, with the most recent noting that the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) alone should provide over 1000 potential targets. In this work, we consider the planet candidates found to date by TESS to show that, with the addition of already confirmed planets, Ariel will already have a more than sufficient sample to choose its target list from once these candidates are validated. We showcase the breadth of this population, as well as exploring, for the first time, the ability of Ariel to characterize multiple planets within a single system. Comparative planetology of worlds orbiting the same star, as well as across the wider population, will undoubtedly revolutionize our understanding of planet formation and evolution.},

	abstract = {The imprints of stellar nucleosynthesis and chemical evolution of the galaxy can be seen in different stellar populations, with older generation stars showing higher α-element abundances and the later generations becoming enriched with iron-peak elements. The evolutionary connections and chemical characteristics of circumstellar disks, stars, and their planetary companions can be inferred by studying the interdependence of planetary and host star properties. Numerous studies in the past have confirmed that high-mass giant planets are commonly found around metal-rich stars, while the stellar hosts of low-mass planets have a wide range of metallicity. In this work, we analyzed the detailed chemical abundances for a sample of {\textgreater}900 exoplanet hosting stars drawn from different radial velocity and transit surveys. We correlate the stellar abundance trends for α- and iron-peak elements with the planets' mass. We find the planet mass-abundance correlation to be primarily negative for α-elements and marginally positive or zero for the iron-peak elements, indicating that stars hosting giant planets are relatively younger. This is further validated by the age of the host stars obtained from isochrone fitting. The later enrichment of protoplanetary material with iron and iron-peak elements is also consistent with the formation of the giant planets via the core accretion process. A higher metal fraction in the protoplanetary disk is conducive to rapid core growth, thus providing a plausible route for the formation of giant planets. This study, therefore, indicates that the observed trends in stellar abundances and planet mass are most likely a natural consequence of Galactic chemical evolution.},

	abstract = {Elias 2-27 is a young star that hosts an extended, bright and inclined disk of dust and gas. The inclination and extreme flaring of the disk make Elias 2-27 an ideal target to study the vertical distribution of molecules, particularly CN. We directly trace the emission of CN in Elias 2-27 and compare it to previously published CO isotopologue data. CN \$N = 3-2\$ emission is analyzed in two different transitions \$J = 7/2 - 5/2\$ and \$J = 5/2 - 3/2\$, for which we detect two hyperfine group transitions. The vertical location of CN emission is traced directly from the channel maps, following geometrical methods that have been previously used to analyze the CO emission of Elias 2-27. Analytical models are used to parametrize the vertical profile of each molecule and study the extent of each tracer, additionally we compute radial profiles of column density and optical depth. We show that the vertical location of CN and CO isotopologues in Elias 2-27 is layered and consistent with predictions from thermochemical models. A north/south asymmetry in the radial extent of CN is detected and we find that the CN emission is mostly optically thin and constrained vertically to a thin slab at \$z/r {\textbackslash}sim\$0.5. A column density of 10\${\textasciicircum}\{14\}\${\textbackslash},cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ is measured in the inner disk which for the north side decreases to 10\${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\${\textbackslash},cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ and for the south side to 10\${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\${\textbackslash},cm\${\textasciicircum}\{-2\}\$ in the outer regions. In Elias 2-27, CN traces a vertically elevated region above the midplane, very similar to that traced by \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO. The inferred CN properties are consistent with thermo-chemical disk models, in which CN formation is initiated by the reaction of N with UV-pumped H\$\_2\$. The observed north/south asymmetry may be caused by either ongoing infall or by a warped inner disk. This study highlights the importance of tracing the vertical location of various molecules to constrain the disk physical conditions.},

We carried out test-particle simulations of \${\textbackslash}sim\$ GeV protons produced at a variety of distances from the M1Ve star AU{\textasciitilde}Microscopii by coronal flares or travelling shocks.

In both cases, magnetic fluctuations with an isotropic power spectrum are overlayed onto the large scale stellar magnetic field and particle propagation out to the two innnermost confirmed planets is examined. In the quiescent case, the magnetic field concentrates the particles onto two regions near the ecliptic plane. After the passage of the CME, the closed field lines remain inflated and the re-shuffled magnetic field remains highly compressed, shrinking the scattering mean free path of the particles. In the direction of propagation of the CME-lobes the subsequent EP flux is suppressed. Even for a CME front propagating out of the ecliptic plane, the EP flux along the planetary orbits highly fluctuates and peaks at \${\textbackslash}sim 2 -3\$ orders of magnitude higher than the average solar value at Earth, both in the quiescent and the post-CME cases.},

The main aim is to detect stellar flares using two-minutes cadence data and to perform statistical analysis. To find and analyze stellar flares we prepared automatic software WARPFINDER. We implemented three methods described in this paper: trend, difference, and profile fitting. Automated search for flares was accompanied by visual inspection. Using our software we analyzed two-minute cadence light curves of 330,000 stars located in the first 39 sectors of TESS observations. As a result, we detected over 25,000 stars showing flare activity with the total number of more than 140,000 flares. This means that about 7.7\% of all the analyzed objects are flaring stars. The estimated flare energies range between \$10{\textasciicircum}\{31\}\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{36\}\$ erg. We prepared a preliminary preview of the statistical distribution of parameters such as a flare duration, amplitudes and energy, and compared it with previous results. The relationship between stellar activity and its spectral type, temperature and mass was also statistically analyzed. Based on the scaling laws, we estimated the average values of the magnetic field strength and length of the flare loops. In our work, we used both single (about 60\%), and double (about 40\%) flare profiles to fit the observational data. The components of the double profile are supposed to be related to the direct heating of the photosphere by non-thermal electrons and back warming processes.},

Cluster to cluster comparisons are essential to determine whether the universality of spin down relations holds. NGC 6709 is selected as a young open cluster for which no rotation periods of members have previously been obtained. This cluster is at a distance of over 1 kpc and has two red giant members. Isochrones place the age of the cluster at around 150 Myr, or approximately the same age as the Pleiades. Photometry is obtained over a multi-month observing season at the robotic observatory STELLA. After basic processing, PSF photometry was derived using Daophot II, and a suite of related software allowed us to create time series of relative magnitude changes for each star. Four time series analysis methods are then applied to these light curves to obtain rotation periods for members stars. We obtain for the first time rotation periods for 45 FGK cluster members of NGC 6709. We compare our rotation periods to Gaia EDR3 colors and find a slow-rotating sequence with increasing rotation periods towards redder stars and a smaller clump of rapid rotators that have not yet joined this sequence. NGC 6709 has rotation periods very similar to that of another Pleiades-age open cluster, NGC 2516.},

	abstract = {Electromagnetic Star-Planet Interaction (SPI) describes the phenomenon, when a planet couples to its host star via electromagnetic forces. Alfvén waves can establish such a coupling by forming Alfvén wings. SPI allows phenomena that we do not know from the Solar System. Wing-wing interaction is such an example, where the Alfvén wings of two planets merge and interact non-linearly. In this paper we focus on the effects that SPI has on other planets and the stellar wind. First, we analyse the different wave structures connected to SPI. The second part then investigates wing-wing interaction. Our study applies a magnetohydrodynamic model to describe a stellar system with multiple possible planets. As an example, we chose TRAPPIST-1 and its two innermost planets. We extended the PLUTO code to simulate collisions between atmospheric neutral particles and plasma ions. Neutral gas clouds imitate the planets and move through the simulation domain. That allows the simulation of fully time-dependent stellar systems. We analysed the wave structures, which result from the interaction between stellar wind and TRAPPIST-1 b. The inward going wave structure is an Alfvén wing. The outward going part of the interaction consists of an Alfvén wing, slow mode waves, the planetary wake and a slow shock. We quantified the strength of the respective wave perturbations at the outer planets to be on the order of 10{\textbackslash}\% to 40{\textbackslash}\% of the local background values of thermal, magnetic and dynamic pressure. Wing-wing interaction occurs due to the relative position of two planets during their conjunction and shows three phases. First there is an initial, non-linear intensification of the Poynting flux by \$20{\textbackslash}\%\$, an intermediate phase with reduced Poynting flux and a third phase when the Alfvén wing of planet c goes through planet b's wave structures with another intensification of the Poynting flux.},

	abstract = {IR surveys indicate that the dust content in debris disks gradually declines with stellar age. We simulated the long-term collisional depletion of debris disks around solar-type (G2 V) stars with our collisional code. The numerical results were supplemented by, and interpreted through, a new analytic model. General scaling rules for the disk evolution are suggested. The timescale of the collisional evolution is inversely proportional to the initial disk mass and scales with radial distance as r4.3 and with eccentricities of planetesimals as e-2.3. Further, we show that at actual ages of debris disks between 10 Myr and 10 Gyr, the decay laws of the dust mass and the total disk mass are different. The reason is that the collisional lifetime of planetesimals is size dependent. At any moment, there exists a transitional size, which separates larger objects that still retain the ``primordial'' size distribution set in the growth phase from smaller objects whose size distribution is already set by disruptive collisions. The dust mass and its decay rate evolve as that transition affects objects of ever larger sizes. Under standard assumptions, the dust mass, fractional luminosity, and thermal fluxes all decrease as tξ with ξ = - 0.3 to -0.4. Specific decay laws of the total disk mass and the dust mass, including the value of ξ, largely depend on a few model parameters, such as the critical fragmentation energy as a function of size, the primordial size distribution of largest planetesimals, and the characteristic eccentricity and inclination of their orbits. With standard material prescriptions and a distribution of disk masses and extents, a synthetic population of disks generated with our analytic model agrees quite well with the observed Spitzer MIPS statistics of 24 and 70 μm fluxes and colors versus age.},

	abstract = {Debris disks are scaled-up analogs of the Kuiper Belt in which dust is generated by collisions between planetesimals. In the "collisional cascade" model of debris disks, dust lost to radiation pressure and winds is constantly replenished by grinding collisions between planetesimals. The model assumes that collisions are destructive and involve large velocities; this assumption has not been tested beyond our Solar System. We present 0"25 (\${\textbackslash}approx\$2.4 au) resolution observations of the \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ = 450 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m dust continuum emission from the debris disk around the nearby M dwarf AU Microscopii with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We use parametric models to describe the disk structure, and an MCMC algorithm to explore the posterior distributions of the model parameters; we fit the structure of the disk to both our data and archival \${\textbackslash}lambda = 1.3\$ mm data (Daley et al. 2019), from which we obtain two aspect ratio measurements at 1.3 mm (\$h\_\{1300\}\$ = 0.025\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.008\}\_\{-0.002\}\$) and at 450 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m (\$h\_\{450\}\$ = 0.019\${\textasciicircum}\{+0.006\}\_\{-0.001\}\$), as well as the grain size distribution index \$q =\$ 3.03 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.02. Contextualizing our aspect ratio measurements within the modeling framework laid out in Pan \& Schlichting (2012), we derive a power law index of velocity dispersion as a function of grain size \$p = 0.28 {\textbackslash}pm 0.06\$ for the AU Mic debris disk. This result implies that smaller bodies are more easily disrupted than larger bodies by collisions, which is inconsistent with the strength regime usually assumed for such small bodies. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed.},

By integrating orbits through the Galactic potential, I identify which of 33 million stars in Gaia DR3 with complete phase space information come close to the Sun. 61 stars formally approach within 1 pc, although there is high confidence in only 42 (two thirds) of these, the rest being spurious measurements or (in) binary systems. Most of the stars will encounter within the past or future 6 Myr; earlier/later encounters are less common due to the magnitude limit of the Gaia radial velocities (RVs). Several close encountering stars are identified for the first time, and the encounter times, distances, and velocities of previously known close encounters are determined more precisely on account of the significantly improved precision of Gaia DR3 over earlier releases. The K7 dwarf Gl 710 remains the closest known encounter, with an estimated (median) encounter distance of 0.0636 pc (90\% confidence interval 0.0595-0.0678 pc) to take place in 1.3 Myr. The new second closest encounter took place 2.8 Myr ago: this was the G3 dwarf HD 7977, now 76 pc away, which approached within less than 0.05 pc of the Sun with a probability of one third. The apparent close encounter of the white dwarf UPM J0812-352 is probably spurious due to an incorrect RV in Gaia DR3.},

	abstract = {The distribution of spin-orbit angles for systems with wide-separation, tidally detached exoplanets offers a unique constraint on the prevalence of dynamically violent planetary evolution histories. Tidally detached planets provide a relatively unbiased view of the primordial stellar obliquity distribution, since they cannot tidally realign within the system lifetime. We present the third result from our Stellar Obliquities in Long-period Exoplanet Systems (SOLES) survey: a measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect across two transits of the tidally detached warm Jupiter TOI-1478 b with the WIYN/NEID and Keck/HIRES spectrographs, revealing a sky-projected spin-orbit angle \${\textbackslash}lambda=6.2{\textasciicircum}\{+5.9\}\_\{-5.5\}\$ degrees. Combining this new measurement with the full set of archival obliquity measurements, including two previous constraints from the SOLES survey, we demonstrate that, in single-star systems, tidally detached warm Jupiters are preferentially more aligned than closer-orbiting hot Jupiters. This finding has two key implications: (1) planets in single-star systems tend to form within aligned protoplanetary disks, and (2) warm Jupiters form more quiescently than hot Jupiters, which, in single-star systems, are likely perturbed into a misaligned state through planet-planet interactions in the post-disk-dispersal phase. We also find that lower-mass Saturns span a wide range of spin-orbit angles, suggesting a prevalence of planet-planet scattering and/or secular mechanisms in these systems.},

Yet, deriving the sulfur abundance is key to understanding the evolution of the chemistry from molecular clouds to planetary atmospheres. We present observations of H\$\_2\$S 110-101 at 168.763 GHz toward the Herbig Ae star AB Aur. We aim to study the abundance of sulfuretted species toward AB Aur and to constrain how different species and phases contribute to the sulfur budget. We present new NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) interferometric observations of the continuum and H\$\_2\$S 110-101 line at 168.763 GHz toward AB Aur. We derived radial and azimuthal profiles and used them to compare the geometrical distribution of different species in the disk. Assuming local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE), we derived column density and abundance maps for H\$\_2\$S, and we further used Nautilus to produce a more detailed model of the chemical abundances at different heights over the mid-plane at a distance of r=200 au. We have resolved H\$\_2\$S emission in the AB Aur protoplanetary disk. The emission comes from a ring extending from 0.67 (109 au) to 1.69 (275 au). Under simple assumptions, we derived an abundance of (3.1\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.8)\${\textbackslash}times\$10\${\textbackslash}rm {\textasciicircum}\{-10\}\$ with respect to H nuclei, which we compare with Nautilus models to deepen our understanding of the sulfur chemistry in protoplanetary disks. Chemical models indicate that H\$-2\$S is an important sulfur carrier in the solid and gas phase. We also find an important transition at a height of 12 au, where the sulfur budget moves from being dominated by ice species to being dominated by gas species. Studying sulfuretted species in detail in the different phases of the interstellar medium is key to solving the issue.},

We observe X-ray luminosities (0.8-3.0 keV) ranging from log Lx 27.7-29.1. We find that our Peter Pan sample exhibits X-ray properties similar to that of weak-lined T-Tauri stars and do not exhibit evidence of stellar accretion induced X-ray suppression. Our observed Peter Pan X-ray luminosities are consistent with that measured for field dM stars of similar spectral type and age, implying their long primordial disk lifetimes are likely not a consequence of unusually faint X-ray host stars. Our derived X-ray photoevaporative mass loss rates predict our systems have passed the point of rapid gas dispersal and call into question the impact of this internal mechanism for primordial disk dispersal around dM stars. Our qualitative assessment of the surrounding Peter Pan environments also does not predict unusually low levels of external photoevaporation relative to other respective moving group members. Overall, our results suggest Peter Pan disks may be a consequence of the low FUV flux incident on the disk in low-mass DM stars given their relatively lower levels of accretion over the course of their pre-main-sequence evolution.},

	abstract = {Debris disks are tenuous, dust-dominated disks commonly observed around stars over a wide range of ages. Those around main sequence stars are analogous to the Solar System's Kuiper Belt and zodiacal light. The dust in debris disks is believed to be continuously regenerated, originating primarily with collisions of planetesimals. Observations of debris disks provide insight into the evolution of planetary systems; and the composition of dust, comets, and planetesimals outside the Solar System; as well as placing constraints on the orbital architecture and potentially the masses of exoplanets that are not otherwise detectable. This review highlights recent advances in multiwavelength, high-resolution scattered light and thermal imaging that have revealed a complex and intricate diversity of structures in debris disks and discusses how modeling methods are evolving with the breadth and depth of the available observations. Two rapidly advancing subfields highlighted in this review include observations of atomic and molecular gas around main sequence stars and variations in emission from debris disks on very short (days to years) timescales, providing evidence of non-steady-state collisional evolution particularly in young debris disks.},

We combine this sample of FGK stars with similar published results to produce a sample of more than 350 main sequence AFGKM stars. The incidence of debris disks is 4.2+ 2.0-1.1\% at 24 μm for a sample of 213 Sun-like (FG) stars and 16.4+ 2.8-2.9\% at 70 μm for 225 Sun-like (FG) stars. We find that the excess rates for A, F, G, and K stars are statistically indistinguishable, but with a suggestion of decreasing excess rate toward the later spectral types; this may be an age effect. The lack of strong trend among FGK stars of comparable ages is surprising, given the factor of 50 change in stellar luminosity across this spectral range. We also find that the incidence of debris disks declines very slowly beyond ages of 1 billion years.},

	abstract = {Millimeter emission from debris disks around stars of different ages provides constraints on the collisional evolution of planetesimals. We present ALMA 1.3 millimeter observations of a sample of 76 Solar-type stars in the {\textasciitilde}115 Myr old Pleiades star cluster. These ALMA observations complement previous infrared observations of this sample by providing sensitivity to emission from circumstellar dust at lower temperatures, corresponding to debris at radii comparable to the Kuiper Belt and beyond. The observations obtain a beam size of 1.5 arcsec (200 au) and a median rms noise of 54 mircoJy/beam, which corresponds to a fractional luminosity \$L\_\{dust\}/L\_\{star\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\$ for 40 K dust for a typical star in the sample. The ALMA images show no significant detections of the targeted stars. We interpret these limits in the context of a steady-state collisional cascade model for debris disk evolution that provides a good description of observations of the field population near the Sun but is not well-calibrated on younger populations.The ALMA non-detections of the Pleiades systems are compatible with the disk flux predictions of this model. We find no high fractional luminosity outliers from these ALMA data that could be associated with enhanced collisions resulting from activity not accounted for by steady-state evolution. However, we note that two systems (HII 1132 and HD 22680) show 24 micron excess much higher than the predictions of this model, perhaps due to unusually high dust production from dynamical events involving planets.},

	abstract = {M dwarfs remain active over longer timescales than their Sunlike counterparts, with potentially devastating implications for the atmospheres of their planets. However, the age at which fully-convective M dwarfs transition from active and rapidly rotating to quiescent and slowly rotating is poorly understood, as these stars remain rapidly rotating in the oldest clusters that are near enough for a large sample of low-mass M dwarfs to be studied. To constrain the spindown of these low-mass stars, we measure photometric rotation periods for field M dwarfs in wide binary systems, primarily using TESS and MEarth. Our analysis includes M-M pairs, which are coeval but of unknown age, as well as M dwarfs with white dwarf or Sunlike primaries, for which we can estimate ages using techniques like white dwarf cooling curves, gyrochronology, and lithium abundance. We find that the epoch of spindown is strongly dependent on mass. Fully-convective M dwarfs initially spin down slowly, with the population of 0.2--0.3M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ rapid rotators evolving from \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\} {\textless} 2\$ days at 600 Myr to \$2 {\textless} P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm rot\} {\textless} 10\$ days at 1--3 Gyr before rapidly spinning down to long rotation periods at older ages. However, we also identify some variability in the spindown of fully-convective M dwarfs, with a small number of stars having substantially spun down by 600 Myr. These observations are consistent with models of magnetic morphology-driven spindown, where angular momentum loss is initially inefficient until changes in the magnetic field allow spindown to progress rapidly.},

The distribution of linear polarization over the stellar disk for different configurations of the magnetic field is studied and its topology discussed. For an unresolved dipole, the resulting polarization can be expressed in terms of just three functions (of the inclination angle and effective dipole strength) that are calculated numerically and their behavior discussed. Dipolar and (aligned) quadrupoles are considered in some detail, but the techniques here—in particular, the extensive use of the spherical tensor formalism for polarization—can easily be applied to more general field configurations.},

	abstract = {Magnetic fields are important for stellar photospheres and magnetospheres, influencing photospheric physics and sculpting stellar winds. Observations of stellar magnetic fields are typically made in the visible, although infrared observations are becoming common. Here we consider the possibility of directly detecting magnetic fields at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths using high resolution spectropolarimetry, specifically considering the capabilities of the proposed Polstar mission. UV observations are particularly advantageous for studying wind resonance lines not available in the visible, but they can also provide many photospheric lines in hot stars. Detecting photospheric magnetic fields using the Zeeman effect and Least Squares Deconvolution is potentially more effective in the UV due to the much higher density of strong lines. We investigate detecting magnetic fields in the magnetosphere of a star using the Zeeman effect in wind lines, and find that this could be detectable at high S/N in an O or B star with a strong magnetic field. We consider detecting magnetic fields using the Hanle effect in linear polarization, which is complementary to the Zeeman effect, and could be more sensitive in photospheric lines of rapid rotators. The Hanle effect can also be used to infer circumstellar magnetism in winds. Detecting the Hanle effect requires UV observations, and a multi-line approach is key for inferring magnetic field properties. This demonstrates that high resolution spectropolarimetry in the UV, and the proposed Polstar mission, has the potential to greatly expand our ability to detect and characterize magnetic fields in and around hot stars.},

We identified 112 M dwarfs with a TESS magnitude {\textless}= 11.5 for which TESS can probe the full habitable zone for transits. These 112 stars have 1276 two-minute cadence TESS light curves from the primary mission, which we searched for rotational modulation and flares. We study the link between rotation and flares and between flare properties, for example the flare amplitude-duration relation and cumulative flare energy frequency distributions (FFDs). Assuming that each optical flare is associated with a flare in the X-ray band, and making use of published simultaneous Kepler/K2 and XMM-Newton flare studies, we estimate the X-ray energy released by our detected TESS flare events. Our calibration also involves the relation between flare energies in the TESS and K2 bands. We detected more than 2500 optical flare events on a fraction of about 32\% of our targets and found reliable rotation periods only for 12 stars, which is a fraction of about 11\%. For these 12 targets, we present cumulative FFDs and FFD power law fits. We construct FFDs in the X-ray band by calibrating optical flare energies to the X-rays. In the absence of directly observed X-ray FFDs for main-sequence stars, our predictions can serve for estimates of the high-energy input to the planet of a typical fast-rotating early- or mid-M dwarf.},

	abstract = {AU Mic is a young and nearby M-dwarf star harbouring a circumstellar debris disk and one recently discovered planet on an 8d orbit. Large-scale structures within the disk were also discovered and are moving outward at high velocity. We aim at studying this system with the highest spatial resolution in order to probe the innermost regions and to search for additional low-mass companion or set detection limits. The star was observed with two different techniques probing complementary spatial scales. We obtained new SAM observations with SPHERE, which we combined with data from NACO, PIONIER and GRAVITY. We did not detect additional companions within 0.02-7au from the star. We determined magnitude upper limits for companions of H{\textasciitilde}9.8mag within 0.02-0.5au, Ks{\textasciitilde}11.2mag within 0.4-2.4au and L'{\textasciitilde}10.7mag within 0.7-7au. Using theoretical isochrones, we converted into mass upper limits of {\textasciitilde}17Mjup, {\textasciitilde}12Mjup and {\textasciitilde}9jup, respectively. The PIONIER observations allowed us to determine the angular diameter of AU Mic, 0.825+/-0.050mas, which converts to R = 0.862+/-0.052Rsun. We did not detect the newly discovered planets, but we derived upper limit masses for the innermost region of AU Mic. We do not have any detection with a significance beyond 3sigma, the most significant signal with PIONIER being 2.9sigma and with SPHERE being 1.6{\textbackslash}sigma. We applied the pyMESS2 code to estimate the detection probability of companions by combining radial velocities, SPHERE imaging and our interferometric detection maps. We show that 99\% of the companions down to {\textasciitilde}0.5Mjup can be detected within 0.02au or 1Mjup down to 0.2au. The low-mass planets orbiting at {\textless}0.11au will not be directly detectable with the current AO and interferometric instruments due to its close orbit and very high contrast ({\textasciitilde}10e-10 in K).

The speed of the prominence was only {\textasciitilde}70 km s-1 when it reached a height of {\textasciitilde}0.5 Rsolar above the solar surface. In X-rays, a large region with reduced X-ray emission was observed enveloping the initial location of the prominence and extending to much larger heights.

This is the first time a direct detailed comparison is made between coronal dimming and a prominence eruption. We were able to confirm that the coronal dimming is indeed a near-surface manifestation of the coronal mass ejection (CME). The orientation of the structures involved did not allow the observations of the coronal cavity, but all the other substructures of the CME could be identified. The mass expelled from the Sun in the form of the eruptive prominence and the coronal dimming are comparable. The estimated total mass is somewhat larger than that reported in other X-ray-dimming events.},

A signal diagnostic of CMEs on the Sun is coronal dimming: a drop in coronal emission, tied to the mass of the CME, that is the direct result of removing emitting plasma from the corona. We present the results of a coronal dimming analysis of Fe XII 1349 A and Fe XXI 1354 A emission from \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Eridani (\${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Eri), a young K2 dwarf, with archival far-ultraviolet observations by the Hubble Space Telescope's Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. Following a flare in February 2015, \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Eri's Fe XXI emission declined by \$81{\textbackslash}pm5\$\%. Although enticing, a scant 3.8 min of preflare observations allows for the possibility that the Fe XXI decline was the decay of an earlier, unseen flare. Dimming nondetections following each of three prominent flares constrain the possible mass of ejected Fe XII-emitting (1 MK) plasma to less than a few \${\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$ g. This implies that CMEs ejecting this much or more 1 MK plasma occur less than a few times per day on \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Eri. On the Sun, \$10{\textasciicircum}\{15\}\$ g CMEs occur once every few days. For \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Eri, the mass loss rate due to CME-ejected 1 MK plasma could be \${\textless}0.6\$ \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, well below the star's estimated 30 \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ mass loss rate (wind + CMEs).

	abstract = {Recent studies of the dynamic evolution of magnetic flux tubes in the solar convection zone are reviewed with focus on emerging flux tubes responsible for the formation of solar active regions. The current prevailing picture is that active regions on the solar surface originate from strong toroidal magnetic fields generated by the solar dynamo mechanism at the thin tachocline layer at the base of the solar convection zone. Thus the magnetic fields need to traverse the entire convection zone before they reach the photosphere to form the observed solar active regions. This review discusses results with regard to the following major topics:1.the equilibrium properties of the toroidal magnetic fields stored in the stable overshoot region at the base of the convection zone,2.the buoyancy instability associated with the toroidal magnetic fields and the formation of buoyant magnetic flux tubes,3.the rise of emerging flux loops through the solar convective envelope as modeled by the thin flux tube calculations which infer that the field strength of the toroidal magnetic fields at the base of the solar convection zone is significantly higher than the value in equipartition with convection,4.the observed hemispheric trend of the twist of the magnetic field in solar active regions and its origin,5.the minimum twist needed for maintaining cohesion of the rising flux tubes,6.the rise of highly twisted kink unstable flux tubes as a possible origin of δ-sunspots,7.the evolution of buoyant magnetic flux tubes in 3D stratified convection,8.turbulent pumping of magnetic flux by penetrative compressible convection,9.an alternative mechanism for intensifying toroidal magnetic fields to significantly super-equipartition field strengths by conversion of the potential energy associated with the superadiabatic stratification of the solar convection zone, and finally10.a brief overview of our current understanding of flux emergence at the surface and post-emergence evolution of the subsurface magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {The archetypical flare star UV Cet was observed by MeerKAT on 5-6 October 2021. A large radio outburst with a duration of \${\textbackslash}sim{\textbackslash}!2\$ hr was observed between 886-1682 MHz with a time resolution of 8s and a frequency resolution of 0.84 MHz, enabling sensitive dynamic spectra to be formed. The emission is characterized by three peaks containing a multitude of broadband arcs or partial arcs in the time-frequency domain. In general, the arcs are highly right-hand circularly polarized. During end of the third peak, brief bursts occur that are significantly elliptically polarized. We present a simple model that appears to be broadly consistent with the characteristics of the radio emission from UV Cet. Briefly, the stellar magnetic field is modeled as a dipole aligned with the rotational axis of the star. The radio emission mechanism is assumed to be due to the cyclotron maser instability where x-mode radiation near the electron gyrofrequency is amplified. While the elliptically polarized bursts may be intrinsic to the source, rather stringent limits are imposed on the plasma density in the source and along the propagation path. We suggest that the elliptically polarized radiation may instead be the result of reflection on an over-dense plasma structure at some distance from the source. Radio emission from UV{\textasciitilde}Cet shares both stellar and planetary attributes.},

Circumstellar dust grains around an M-dwarf star are simultaneously heated by superflare radiation. One can thus expect their re-emission in the MIR wavelength regime. According to our model calculations for the Proxima Centauri system, the nearest M-dwarf star system, thermal emission echoes from an inner (r {\textless} 1 au) debris disk with a total mass down to that of the solar system's zodiacal dust are expected to emerge at wavelengths longer than {\textasciitilde}10 μm with a strength comparable to or greater than a white-light superflare. Also, observable echoes from inner- (r ≲ 0.5 au) debris disks irradiated by energetic ( ≳1033.5 erg) superflares of nearby (D {\textless} 3 pc) M dwarfs are expected. Our simulation results indicate that superflare monitoring using high-speed optical instruments like OASES and its prompt follow-up using ground-based MIR instruments, such as TAO/MIMIZUKU, can detect these MIR light echoes from debris disks around solar neighborhood flare stars.},

The aim of this work is to explore the dynamo solutions and magnetic fields of fully convective M dwarfs with varying magnetic Prandtl numbers \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Pr\_M\}\$, and a rotation period (\$\{{\textbackslash}rm P\_\{rot\}\}\$) of 43 days. \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Pr\_M\}\$ is known to play an important role in the dynamo action; dynamos for low-\${\textbackslash}rm Pr\_M\$ and large-\${\textbackslash}rm Pr\_M\$ have very different properties. We performed three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations with the ``star-in-a-box'' model using stellar parameters for an M5 dwarf with \$0.21 M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. We found that the dynamo solutions are sensitive to \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Pr\_M\}\$. The simulations at this rotation period present periodic cycles of the large-scale magnetic field up to \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Pr\_M\} {\textbackslash}leq 2\$; for higher values the cycles disappear and irregular solutions to arise. Our results are consistent with previous studies and suggest that the dynamos operating in fully convective stars behave similarly as those in partially convective stars.},

	abstract = {Stars provide an enormous gain for interstellar communications at their gravitational focus, perhaps as part of an interstellar network. If the Sun is part of such a network, there should be probes at the gravitational foci of nearby stars. If there are probes within the solar system connected to such a network, we might detect them by intercepting transmissions from relays at these foci. Here, we demonstrate a search across a wide bandwidth for interstellar communication relays beyond the Sun's innermost gravitational focus at 550 AU using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and Breakthrough Listen (BL) backend. As a first target, we searched for a relay at the focus of the Alpha Centauri AB system while correcting for the parallax due to Earth's orbit around the Sun. We searched for radio signals directed at the inner solar system from such a source in the L and S bands. Our analysis, utilizing the turboSETI software developed by BL, did not detect any signal indicative of a non-human-made artificial origin. Further analysis excluded false negatives and signals from the nearby target HD 13908. Assuming a conservative gain of 10{\textasciicircum}3 in L-band and roughly 4 times that in S-band, a {\textasciitilde}1 meter directed transmitter would be detectable by our search above 7 W at 550 AU or 23 W at 1000 AU in L-band, and above 2 W at 550 AU or 7 W at 1000 AU in S-band. Finally, we discuss the application of this method to other frequencies and targets.},

	abstract = {A breakthrough in exoplanet detections is foreseen with the unprecedented astrometric measurement capabilities offered by instrumentation aboard Gaia space observatory. Besides, astrometric discoveries of exoplanets are expected from the planned space mission, Small-JASMINE. In this setting, the present series of papers focuses on estimating the effect of magnetic activity of G2V-type host stars on the astrometric signal. This effect interferes with the astrometric detections of Earth-mass planets. While the first two papers considered stars rotating at the solar rotation rate, this paper focuses on stars having solar effective temperature and metallicity but rotating faster than the Sun, and consequently more active. By simulating the distribution of active regions on such stars using the Flux Emergence And Transport model, we show that the contribution of magnetic activity to the astrometric measurements becomes increasingly significant with increasing rotation rates. We further show that the jitter for the most variable periodic Kepler stars is high enough to be detected by Gaia. Furthermore, due to a decrease in the facula-to-spot area ratio for more active stars, the magnetic jitter is found to be spot-dominated for rapid rotators. Our simulations of the astrometric jitter has the potential to aid the interpretation of data from Gaia and upcoming space astrometry missions.},

In a relativistic interstellar spacecraft's reference frame, the interstellar medium (ISM) will look like a nearly monoenergetic beam of charged particles which impinges upon the leading edge of the spacecraft. Upon impact, ISM protons and electrons will travel characteristic lengths through the spacecraft shield and come to a stop via electronic and nuclear stopping mechanisms. As a result, bremsstrahlung photons will be produced within the spacecraft shield. In this work, we discuss the interstellar environment and its implications for radiation damage on relativistic spacecraft. We also explore expected radiation doses in terms of onboard device radiation tolerance.},

A combination of a wavelet analysis, a Fourier transform plus an empirical mode decomposition, reveals quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) that exhibit an apparent doubling of the oscillation period. Both events showed oscillations of a few minutes over a interval of several minutes, and despite the availability of sub-second cadence, there was no evidence of sub-minute oscillations. The doubling of the QPP periods and shorter lifetime of shorter-period QPP modes strongly favour resonant dynamics of magnetohydrodynamic waves in a coronal loop. We estimate loop lengths to be 0.2-0.7 R⋆, in agreement with a typical length of solar coronal loops. These observations presents rare and compelling evidence for the presence of compact plasma loops in a stellar corona.},

	abstract = {The rotation rates of main-sequence stars slow over time as they gradually lose angular momentum to their magnetized stellar winds. The rate of angular momentum loss depends on the strength and morphology of the magnetic field, the mass-loss rate, and the stellar rotation period, mass, and radius. Previous observations suggested a shift in magnetic morphology between two F-type stars with similar rotation rates but very different ages (88 Leo and ρ CrB). In this Letter, we identify a comparable transition in an evolutionary sequence of solar analogs with ages between 2-7 Gyr. We present new spectropolarimetry of 18 Sco and 16 Cyg A and B from the Large Binocular Telescope, and we reanalyze previously published Zeeman Doppler images of HD 76151 and 18 Sco, providing additional constraints on the nature and timing of this transition. We combine archival X-ray observations with updated distances from Gaia to estimate mass-loss rates, and we adopt precise stellar properties from asteroseismology and other sources. We then calculate the wind braking torque for each star in the evolutionary sequence, demonstrating that the rate of angular momentum loss drops by more than an order of magnitude between the ages of HD 76151 and 18 Sco (2.6-3.7 Gyr) and continues to decrease modestly to the age of 16 Cyg A and B (7 Gyr). We suggest that this magnetic transition may represent a disruption of the global dynamo arising from weaker differential rotation, and we outline plans to probe this phenomenon in additional stars spanning a wide range of spectral types.},

We here report an observational study on flares of two M-dwarfs triggered by the high-cadence survey performed by the Ground Wide-angle Camera system.

The variation amplitudes are at tens of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km{\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, which could be ascribed to the chromospheric evaporation in one event, and to a binary scenario in the other one.

	abstract = {The Gaia DR3 Catalogue contains for the first time about eight hundred thousand solutions with either orbital elements or trend parameters for astrometric, spectroscopic and eclipsing binaries, and combinations of them. This paper aims to illustrate the huge potential of this large non-single star catalogue. Using the orbital solutions together with models of the binaries, a catalogue of tens of thousands of stellar masses, or lower limits, partly together with consistent flux ratios, has been built. Properties concerning the completeness of the binary catalogues are discussed, statistical features of the orbital elements are explained and a comparison with other catalogues is performed. Illustrative applications are proposed for binaries across the H-R diagram. The binarity is studied in the RGB/AGB and a search for genuine SB1 among long-period variables is performed. The discovery of new EL CVn systems illustrates the potential of combining variability and binarity catalogues. Potential compact object companions are presented, mainly white dwarf companions or double degenerates, but one candidate neutron star is also presented. Towards the bottom of the main sequence, the orbits of previously-suspected binary ultracool dwarfs are determined and new candidate binaries are discovered. The long awaited contribution of Gaia to the analysis of the substellar regime shows the brown dwarf desert around solar-type stars using true, rather than minimum, masses, and provides new important constraints on the occurrence rates of substellar companions to M dwarfs. Several dozen new exoplanets are proposed, including two with validated orbital solutions and one super-Jupiter orbiting a white dwarf, all being candidates requiring confirmation. Beside binarity, higher order multiple systems are also found.},

Accurate modeling as well as an understanding of the formation of these lines are needed to interpret the SST/CHROMIS observations. Such modeling is computationally challenging because these lines are influenced by strong departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium, three-dimensional radiative transfer, and partially coherent resonance scattering of photons.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aim.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We aim to model the Ca II H and K lines in 3D model atmospheres to understand their formation and to investigate their diagnostic potential for probing the chromosphere.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We model the synthetic spectrum of Ca II using the radiative transfer code Multi3D in three different radiation-magnetohydrodynamic model atmospheres computed with the Bifrost code. We classify synthetic intensity profiles according to their shapes and study how their features are related to the physical properties in the model atmospheres. We investigate whether the synthetic data reproduce the observed spatially-averaged line shapes, center-to-limb variation and compare this data with SST/CHROMIS images.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The spatially-averaged synthetic line profiles show too low central emission peaks, and too small separation between the peaks. The trends of the observed center-to-limb variation of the profiles properties are reproduced by the models. The Ca II H and K line profiles provide a temperature diagnostic of the temperature minimum and the temperature at the formation height of the emission peaks. The Doppler shift of the central depression is an excellent probe of the velocity in the upper chromosphere.},

	abstract = {The Gaia Radial Velocity Spectrometer provides the unique opportunity of a spectroscopic analysis of millions of stars at medium-resolution in the near-infrared. This wavelength range includes the Ca II infrared triplet (IRT), which is a good diagnostics of magnetic activity in the chromosphere of late-type stars. Here we present the method devised for inferring the Gaia stellar activity index together with its scientific validation. A sample of well studied PMS stars is considered to identify the regime in which the Gaia stellar activity index may be affected by mass accretion. The position of these stars in the colour-magnitude diagram and the correlation with the amplitude of the photometric rotational modulation is also scrutinised. Three regimes of the chromospheric stellar activity are identified, confirming suggestions made by previous authors on much smaller \$R'\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HK\}\$ datasets. The highest stellar activity regime is associated with PMS stars and RS CVn systems, in which activity is enhanced by tidal interaction. Some evidence of a bimodal distribution in MS stars with \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}{\textbackslash}ge\$ 5000 K is also found, which defines the two other regimes, without a clear gap in between. Stars with 3500 K\${\textbackslash}le T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} {\textbackslash}le\$ 5000 K are found to be either very active PMS stars or active MS stars with a unimodal distribution in chromospheric activity. A dramatic change in the activity distribution is found for \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}{\textbackslash}le\$3500 K, with a dominance of low activity stars close to the transition between partially- and fully-convective stars and a rise in activity down into the fully-convective regime.},

	abstract = {Gaia Data Release 3 provides novel flux-calibrated low-resolution spectrophotometry for about 220 million sources in the wavelength range 330nm - 1050nm (XP spectra). Synthetic photometry directly tied to a flux in physical units can be obtained from these spectra for any passband fully enclosed in this wavelength range. We describe how synthetic photometry can be obtained from XP spectra, illustrating the performance that can be achieved under a range of different conditions - for example passband width and wavelength range - as well as the limits and the problems affecting it. Existing top-quality photometry can be reproduced within a few per cent over a wide range of magnitudes and colour, for wide and medium bands, and with up to millimag accuracy when synthetic photometry is standardised with respect to these external sources. Some examples of potential scientific application are presented, including the detection of multiple populations in globular clusters, the estimation of metallicity extended to the very metal-poor regime, and the classification of white dwarfs. A catalogue providing standardised photometry for {\textasciitilde}220 million sources in several wide bands of widely used photometric systems is provided (Gaia Synthetic Photometry Catalogue; GSPC) as well as a catalogue of \${\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}5\$ white dwarfs with DA/non-DA classification obtained with a Random Forest algorithm (Gaia Synthetic Photometry Catalogue for White Dwarfs; GSPC-WD).},

	shorttitle = {The halo around {HD} 32297},
	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220607068O},
	abstract = {The optical properties of the second generation dust that we observe in debris disks remain quite elusive, whether it is the absorption efficiencies at millimeter wavelengths or the (un)polarized phase function at near-infrared wavelengths. Thankfully the same particles are experiencing forces that are size dependent (e.g., radiation pressure), and with high angular resolution observations we can take advantage of this natural spatial segregation. Observations at different wavelengths probe different ranges of sizes, and there is therefore a great synergy in multi-wavelength observations to better constrain the optical properties of the particles. We present a new approach to simultaneously model SPHERE and ALMA observations and apply it to the debris disk around HD{\textbackslash},32297, putting the emphasis on the spatial distribution of the grains with different \${\textbackslash}beta\$ values. This modeling approach requires few assumptions on the actual sizes of the particles and the interpretation can therefore be done a posteriori. We find that the ALMA observations are best reproduced with a combination of small and large \${\textbackslash}beta\$ values (\$0.03\$ and \$0.42\$) while the SPHERE observations require several intervals of \${\textbackslash}beta\$ values. We discuss the nature of the halo previously reported in ALMA observations, and hypothesize it could be caused by over-abundant \${\textbackslash}mu\$m-sized particles (the over-abundance being the consequence of their extended lifetime). We model the polarized phase function at near-infrared wavelengths and fluffy aggregates larger than a few \${\textbackslash}mu\$m provide the best solution. Comparing our results with comets of the solar system, we postulate that the particles released in the disk originate from rather pristine cometary bodies (to avoid compaction of the fluffy aggregates) and are then set on highly eccentric orbits, which could explain the halo detected at long wavelengths.},

The detected companions and the targets are located at the same distance and share a common proper motion, as expected for components of gravitationally bound stellar systems, as proven with their accurate Gaia EDR3 astrometry. The companions have masses in the range between about 0.09 and 2.5\$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and are most frequently found in the mass range between 0.15 and 0.8\$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$. The companions exhibit projected separations to the targets between about 50 to 9700au and their frequency is the highest and constant up to about 500au, while it decreases for larger projected separations. In addition to mainly mid M to early K dwarfs, 4 white dwarf companions were detected in this survey, whose true nature could be identified with their photometric properties.},

	abstract = {Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) provides a wealth of new data products for the astronomical community to exploit, including astrophysical parameters for a half billion stars. In this work we demonstrate the high quality of these data products and illustrate their use in different astrophysical contexts. We query the astrophysical parameter tables along with other tables in Gaia DR3 to derive the samples of the stars of interest. We validate our results by using the Gaia catalogue itself and by comparison with external data. We have produced six homogeneous samples of stars with high quality astrophysical parameters across the HR diagram for the community to exploit. We first focus on three samples that span a large parameter space: young massive disk stars ({\textasciitilde}3M), FGKM spectral type stars ({\textasciitilde}3M), and UCDs ({\textasciitilde}20K). We provide these sources along with additional information (either a flag or complementary parameters) as tables that are made available in the Gaia archive. We furthermore identify 15740 bone fide carbon stars, 5863 solar-analogues, and provide the first homogeneous set of stellar parameters of the Spectro Photometric Standard Stars. We use a subset of the OBA sample to illustrate its usefulness to analyse the Milky Way rotation curve. We then use the properties of the FGKM stars to analyse known exoplanet systems. We also analyse the ages of some unseen UCD-companions to the FGKM stars. We additionally predict the colours of the Sun in various passbands (Gaia, 2MASS, WISE) using the solar-analogue sample.},

Only for the Sun, spectral activity indices can be related to evolving magnetic features on the solar disk. The Solar Disk-Integrated (SDI) telescope feeds the Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) at Mt. Graham International Observatory (MGIO), Arizona, U.S.A. We present high-resolution, high-fidelity spectra that were recorded on 184 \& 82 days in 2018 \& 2019 and derive the Ca H \& K emission ratio, i.e., the S-index. In addition, we compile excess brightness and area indices based on full-disk Ca K line-core filtergrams of the Chromospheric Telescope (ChroTel) at Observatorio del Teide, Tenerife, Spain and full-disk ultraviolet (UV) 1600{\textasciitilde}Å images of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Thus, Sun-as-a-star spectral indices are related to their counterparts derived from resolved images of the solar chromosphere. All indices display signatures of rotational modulation, even during the very low magnetic activity in the minimum of Solar Cycle 24. Bringing together different types of activity indices has the potential to join disparate chromospheric datasets, yielding a comprehensive description of chromospheric activity across many solar cycles.},

	abstract = {We simulate the space environment around AU Microscopii b and the interaction between the magnetized stellar wind with a planetary atmospheric outflow for ambient stellar wind conditions and Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) conditions. We also calculate synthetic Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ absorption due to neutral hydrogen in the ambient and the escaping planetary atmosphere affected by this interaction. We find that the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ absorption is highly variable due to the highly-varying stellar wind conditions. A strong Doppler blue-shift component is observed in the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ profile, in contradiction to the actual escape velocity observed in the simulations themselves. This result suggest that the strong Doppler blue-shift is likely attributed to the stellar wind, not the escaping neutral atmosphere, either through its advection of neutral planetary gas, or through the creation of a fast neutral flow via charge exchange between the stellar wind ions and the planetary neutrals. Indeed, our CME simulations indicate a strong stripping of magnetospheric material from the planet, including some of the neutral escaping atmosphere. Our simulations show that the pressure around close-in exoplanets is not much lower, and may be even higher, than the pressure at the top of the planetary atmosphere. Thus, the neutral atmosphere is hydrodynamically escaping with a very small velocity (\${\textless}15{\textasciitilde}km{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$). Moreover, our simulations show that an MHD treatment is essential in order to properly capture the coupled magnetized stellar wind and the escaping atmosphere, despite of the atmosphere being neutral. This coupling should be considered when interpreting Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$observations in the context of exoplanets atmospheric escape.},

The solar-cycle variation of acoustic mode power in the 5-min band is clearly seen. Unusually, even though Cycle 24 was substantially weaker in terms of surface magnetic activity than Cycle 23, the reduction in mode power at solar maximum is very similar for the two cycles, suggesting that the relationship between mode power and magnetic activity is more complex than has previously been thought. This is in contrast to the mode frequencies, which show a strong correlation with activity with only subtle differences in the response across different solar cycles.},

Here we explore convection in main-sequence stars through two lenses: dimensionless parameters arising from stellar structure and parameters which emerge from the application of mixing length theory. We first define each quantity in terms familiar both to the 1D stellar evolution community and the hydrodynamics community. We then explore the variation of these quantities across different convection zones, different masses, and different stages of main-sequence evolution. We find immense diversity across stellar convection zones. Convection occurs in thin shells, deep envelopes, and nearly-spherical cores; it can be efficient of inefficient, rotationally constrained or not, transsonic or deeply subsonic. This atlas serves as a guide for future theoretical and observational investigations by indicating which regimes of convection are active in a given star, and by describing appropriate model assumptions for numerical simulations.},

We report 5 yr (2013-2018) of monitoring of the position and Hα excess luminosity of the embedded, accreting low-mass stellar companion HD 142527 B from the MagAO/VisAO instrument. We use pyklip, a Python implementation of the Karhunen-Loeve Image Processing algorithm, to detect the companion. Using pyklip forward modeling, we constrain the relative astrometry to 1-2 mas precision and achieve sufficient photometric precision (±0.2 mag, 3\% error) to detect changes in the Hα contrast of the companion over time. In order to accurately determine the relative astrometry of the companion, we conduct an astrometric calibration of the MagAO/VisAO camera against 20 yr of Keck/NIRC2 images of the Trapezium cluster. We demonstrate agreement of our VisAO astrometry with other published positions for HD 142527 B, and use orbitize! to generate a posterior distribution of orbits fit to the relative astrometry of HD 142527 B. Our data suggest that the companion is close to periastron passage, on an orbit significantly misaligned with respect to both the wide circumbinary disk and the recently observed inner disk encircling HD 142527 A. We translate observed Hα contrasts for HD 142527 B into mass accretion rate estimates on the order of 4-9 × 10-10 M ⊙ yr-1. Photometric variation in the Hα excess of the companion suggests that the accretion rate onto the companion is variable. This work represents a significant step toward observing accretion-driven variability onto protoplanets, such as PDS 70 b\&c.},

	abstract = {Stellar flares sometimes show red/blue asymmetries of the Hα line, which can indicate chromospheric dynamics and prominence activations. However, the origin of asymmetries is not completely understood. For a deeper understanding of stellar data, we performed a Sun-as-a-star analysis of Hα line profiles of an M4.2-class solar flare showing dominant emissions from flare ribbons by using the data of the Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager on board the Solar Magnetic Activity Research Telescope at the Hida Observatory. Sun-as-a-star Hα spectra of the flare show red asymmetry of up to {\textasciitilde}95 km s-1 and line broadening of up to {\textasciitilde}7.5 Å. The Sun-as-a-star Hα profiles are consistent with spectra from flare regions with weak intensity, but they take smaller redshift velocities and line widths by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 than those with strong intensity. The redshift velocities, as well as line widths, peak out and decay more rapidly than the Hα equivalent widths, which is consistent with the chromospheric condensation model and spatially resolved flare spectra. This suggests that as a result of superposition, the nature of chromospheric condensation is observable even from stellar flare spectra. The time evolution of redshift velocities is found to be similar to that of luminosities of near-ultraviolet rays (1600 Å), while the time evolution of line broadening is similar to that of optical white lights. These Hα spectral behaviors in Sun-as-a-star view could be helpful to distinguish whether the origin of Hα red asymmetry of stellar flares is a flare ribbon or other phenomena.},

The detection of planets with the shortest known periods, 1.2-2.5 days, has mainly resulted from transit surveys which have generally targeted stars more massive than 0.75Msolar, where Msolar is the mass of the Sun. Here we report the results from a planetary transit search performed in a rich stellar field towards the Galactic bulge. We discovered 16 candidates with orbital periods between 0.4 and 4.2 days, five of which orbit stars of masses in the range 0.44-0.75Msolar. In two cases, radial-velocity measurements support the planetary nature of the companions. Five candidates have orbital periods below 1.0 day, constituting a new class of ultra-short-period planets, which occur only around stars of less than 0.88Msolar. This indicates that those orbiting very close to more-luminous stars might be evaporatively destroyed or that jovian planets around stars of lower mass might migrate to smaller radii.},

In this paper, we present the first map of Luhman 16A, and maps of Luhman 16B for two epochs. Our maps were created by applying Aeolus, a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo code that maps the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) structure of brown dwarf and other ultracool atmospheres, to light curves of Luhman 16A and B using the Hubble Space Telescope’s G141 and G102 grisms. Aeolus retrieved three or four spots in the TOA of Luhman 16A and B, with a surface coverage of 19\%-32\% (depending on an assumed rotational period of 5 hr or 8 hr) or 21\%-38.5\% (depending on the observational epoch), respectively. The brightness temperature of the spots of the best-fit models was ∼200 K hotter than the background TOA. We compared our Luhman 16B map with the only previously published map. Interestingly, our map contained a large TOA spot that was cooler (ΔT ∼ 51 K) than the background, which lay at low latitudes, in agreement with the previous Luhman 16B map. Finally, we report the detection of a feature reappearing in Luhman 16B light curves that are separated by tens of hundreds of rotations from each other. We speculate that this feature is related to TOA structures of Luhman 16B.},

	abstract = {We present empirical relations for determining the amount by which the effective temperatures and radii—and therefore the estimated masses—of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are altered due to chromospheric activity. We base our relations on a large set of low-mass stars in the field with Hα activity measurements, and on a set of low-mass eclipsing binaries with X-ray activity measurements from which we indirectly infer the Hα activity. Both samples yield consistent relations linking the amount by which an active object's temperature is suppressed, and its radius inflated, to the strength of its Hα emission. These relations are found to approximately preserve bolometric luminosity. We apply these relations to the peculiar brown dwarf eclipsing binary 2M0535−05, in which the active, higher-mass brown dwarf has a cooler temperature than its inactive, lower-mass companion. The relations correctly reproduce the observed temperatures and radii of 2M0535−05 after accounting for the Hα emission; 2M0535−05 would be in precise agreement with theoretical isochrones were it is inactive. The relations that we present are applicable to brown dwarfs and low-mass stars with masses below 0.8 M☉ and for which the activity, as measured by the fractional Hα luminosity, is in the range −4.6 ≲ log LHα/Lbol ≲ − 3.3. We expect these relations to be most useful for correcting radius and mass estimates of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs over their active lifetimes (few Gyr) and when the ages or distances (and therefore luminosities) are unknown. We also discuss the implications of this work for improved determinations of young cluster initial mass functions.},

	abstract = {We report Kech Observatory high-resolution echelle spectra from 640-850 nm for eight stars near the faint end of the main sequence. These spectra are the highest resolution spectra of such late-type stars, and clearly resolve the TiO, VO, and atomic lines. The sample includes the field brown-dwarf candidate, BRI 0021-0214 (M9.5+). Very unexpectedly, it shows the most rapid rotation in the entire samples, v sin i approximately 40 km/s, which is 20x faster than typical field nonemission M stars. Equally surprising is that BRI 0021 exhibits no emission or absorptionat H-alpha. We argue that this absence is not simply due to its cool photosphere, but that stellar activity declines in a fundamental way at the end of the main sequence. As it is the first very late M dwarf observed at high spectral resolution, BRI 0021 may be signaling a qualitative change in the angular momentum loss rate among the lowest mass stars. Conventionally, its rapid rotation would have marked BRI 0021 as very young, consistent with the selection effect which arises if the latest-type dwarfs are really brown dwarfs on cooling curves. In any case, it is unprecedented to find no sign of stellar activity in such a rapidly rotating convective star. We also discuss the possible conflict between this observation and the extremely strong H-alpha seen in another very cool star, PC 0025+0447. Extrapolation of M-L relations for BRI 0021 yields M approximately 0.065 solar mass, and the other sample objects have expected masses near the H-burning limit. These include two Pleiades brown-dwarf candidates, four field M6 dwarfs and one late-type T Tauri star. The two Pleiades M6 dwarfs have v sin i of 26 and 37 km/s, H-alpha in emission, and radial velocities consistent with Pleiades M6 dwarfs have v sin i of 26 and 37 km/s, H-alpha in emission, and radial velocities consistent with Pleiades membership. Similarly, the late-type T Tauri star has v sin i approximately 30 km/s and H alpha emission indicate of its youth. Two of the four late-type field dMe star also exhibit rotation above 5 km/s, consistent with expectations. BRI 0021 has no measurable absoprtion due to lithium, indicating that it is likely to be more massive than 0.065 solar mass.},

Our goal is to assign effective temperatures to the objects using detailed atmospheric models and fine analysis of the alkali resonance absorption lines of Cs I and Rb I. These yield mutually consistent results (+/-50 K) when we use ``cleared-dust'' models, which account for the removal of refractory species from the molecular states but do not include dust opacities. We find a tendency for the Rb I line to imply a slightly higher temperature, which we ascribe to an incomplete treatment of the overlying molecular opacities. The final Teff we adopt are based on the Cs I fits alone, though the Rb I fits support the Cs I temperature sequence. This work, in combination with results from the infrared, hints that dust in these atmospheres has settled out of the high atmosphere but is present in the deep photosphere. We also derive radial and rotational velocities for all the objects, finding that the previously discovered trend of rapid rotation for very low mass objects is quite pervasive. To improve on our analysis, there is a clear need for better molecular line lists and a more detailed understanding of dust formation and dynamics.},

Spectroscopic follow-up observations identify 53 M7-M9.5 dwarfs and seven L dwarfs. The observed space density is 0.0045+/-0.0008 M8-M9.5 dwarfs per cubic parsec, without accounting for biases, consistent with a mass function that is smooth across the stellar/substellar limit. We show the observed frequency of Hα emission peaks at {\textasciitilde}100\% for M7 dwarfs and then decreases for cooler dwarfs. In absolute terms, however, as measured by the ratio of Hα to bolometric luminosity, none of the ultracool M dwarfs can be considered very active compared to earlier M dwarfs, and we show that the decrease that begins at spectral type M6 continues to the latest L dwarfs. We find that flaring is common among the coolest M dwarfs and estimate the frequency of flares at 7\% or higher. We show that the kinematics of relatively active (EW{\textgreater}6 Å) ultracool M dwarfs are consistent with an ordinary old disk stellar population, while the kinematics of inactive ultracool M dwarfs are more typical of a 0.5 Gyr old population. The early L dwarfs in the sample have kinematics consistent with old ages, suggesting that the hydrogen-burning limit is near spectral types L2-L4. We use the available data on M and L dwarfs to show that chromospheric activity drops with decreasing mass and temperature and that at a given (M8 or later) spectral type, the younger field (brown) dwarfs are less active than many of the older, more massive field stellar dwarfs. Thus, contrary to the well-known stellar age-activity relationship, low activity in field ultracool dwarfs can be an indication of comparative youth and substellar mass.},

Our particular emphasis is on the post-main-sequence evolution of these objects. We establish a hydrogen-burning timescale of τH {\textasciitilde} 1.0 × 1013 years for the minimum-mass main-sequence star. This timescale determines the duration over which the light of our Galaxy is dominated by a conventional stellar contribution. We find that for masses M* {\textless} 0.25 M⊙, stars remain fully convective for a significant fraction of the duration of their evolution. The maintenance of full convection precludes the development of large composition gradients and allows the entire star to build up a large helium mass fraction. We find that stars with masses M {\textless} 0.20 M⊙ will never evolve through a red giant stage. After becoming gradually brighter and bluer for trillions of years, these late M dwarfs of today will develop radiative-conductive cores and mild nuclear shell sources; these stars then end their lives as helium white dwarfs. Our work has significant bearing on the general question of why stars become red giants. The fact that the lowest mass stars grow neither red nor giant as they evolve provides an important insight into this problem. Through both analytical and numerical arguments, we have determined that the development of low-mass red giants requires a combination of (1) increasing core luminosity, (2) the existence of molecular weight gradients between the core and the envelope, and (3) the presence of an atmospheric opacity which is an increasing function of temperature. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results with regards to the long-term fate and evolution of the Galaxy.},

	abstract = {Stable, hydrogen-burning, M dwarf stars make up about 75\% of all stars in the Galaxy. They are extremely long-lived, and because they are much smaller in mass than the Sun (between 0.5 and 0.08 MSun), their temperature and stellar luminosity are low and peaked in the red. We have re-examined what is known at present about the potential for a terrestrial planet forming within, or migrating into, the classic liquid-surface-water habitable zone close to an M dwarf star. Observations of protoplanetary disks suggest that planet-building materials are common around M dwarfs, but N-body simulations differ in their estimations of the likelihood of potentially habitable, wet planets that reside within their habitable zones, which are only about one-fifth to 1/50th of the width of that for a G star. Particularly in light of the claimed detection of the planets with masses as small as 5.5 and 7.5 MEarth orbiting M stars, there seems no reason to exclude the possibility of terrestrial planets. Tidally locked synchronous rotation within the narrow habitable zone does not necessarily lead to atmospheric collapse, and active stellar flaring may not be as much of an evolutionarily disadvantageous factor as has previously been supposed. We conclude that M dwarf stars may indeed be viable hosts for planets on which the origin and evolution of life can occur. A number of planetary processes such as cessation of geothermal activity or thermal and nonthermal atmospheric loss processes may limit the duration of planetary habitability to periods far shorter than the extreme lifetime of the M dwarf star.

The reconstruction process is usually solved by translating the inverse problem into a regularized least-square or optimization problem. In this contribution we will emphasize that ZDI is an inherent non-linear problem and the corresponding regularized optimization is, like many non-linear problems, potentially prone to local minima. We show how this problem will be exacerbated by using an inadequate forward model. To facilitate a more consistent full radiative transfer driven approach to ZDI we describe a two-stage strategy that consist of a principal component analysis (PCA) based line profile reconstruction and a fast approximate polarized radiative transfer method to synthesize local Stokes profiles. Moreover, we introduce a novel statistical inversion method based on artificial neural networks (ANN) which provide a fast calculation of a first guess model and allows to incorporate better physical constraints into the inversion process.},

However, the observational resources required to find and characterize binaries are expensive. With the release of high-precision Gaia astrometry, the re-normalized unit weight error (RUWE) statistic has been shown to reveal the presence of binary systems, with RUWE values greater than 1.2 indicating the presence of a stellar companion within {\textasciitilde}1″. Our goal is to assess whether this new diagnostic, which was developed for field-age systems ({\textgreater}1 Gyr), applies to young systems; specifically, those that host circumstellar disks. With a control sample of single-star systems, compiled from high-contrast imagining surveys of the Taurus and Upper Scorpius star-forming regions, we compare the RUWE values for systems with and without circumstellar disks. We show that the presence of a protoplanetary disk alone can result in inflated RUWE values. Based on the distribution of the RUWE for disk-bearing single stars, we suggest a more conservative single-star-binary threshold is warranted in the presence of disk material. We place this cutoff at the distribution's 95th percentile, with RUWE = 2.5.},

	abstract = {The formation of gas giant planets must occur during the first few Myr of a star's lifetime, when the protoplanetary disc still contains sufficient gas to be accreted on to the planetary core. The majority of protoplanetary discs are exposed to strong ultraviolet irradiation from nearby massive stars, which drives winds and depletes the mass budget for planet formation. It remains unclear to what degree external photoevaporation affects the formation of massive planets. In this work, we present a simple one dimensional model for the growth and migration of a massive planet under the influence of external FUV fields. We find that even moderate FUV fluxes FFUV ≳ 100 G0 have a strong influence on planet mass and migration. By decreasing the local surface density and shutting off accretion on to the planet, external irradiation suppresses planet masses and halts migration early. The distribution of typical stellar birth environments can therefore produce an anti-correlation between semi-major axis and planet mass, which may explain the apparent decrease in planet occurrence rates at orbital periods Porb ≳ 103 days. Even moderate fluxes FFUV strongly suppress giant planet formation and inward migration for any initial semi-major axis if the stellar host mass M* ≲ 0.5 M⊙, consistent with findings that massive planet occurrence is much lower around such stars. The outcomes of our prescription for external disc depletion show significant differences to the current approximation adopted in state-of-the-art population synthesis models, motivating future careful treatment of this important process.},

In a model-independent approach, embedded protoplanets should be found at the roots of abrupt Doppler flips in velocity centroid maps. However, the largest velocity perturbation known for an unwarped disk, in the disk of HD 100546, leads to a conspicuous Doppler flip that coincides with a thick dust ring, in contradiction with an interpretation in terms of a ≳1 M jup body. Here we present new ALMA observations of the 12CO(2-1) kinematics in HD 100546, with a factor of 2 finer angular resolutions. We find that the disk rotation curve is consistent with a central mass 2.1 {\textless} M ⋆/M ⊙ {\textless} 2.3 and that the blueshifted side of the Doppler flip is due to vertical motions, reminiscent of the disk wind proposed previously from blueshifted SO lines. We tentatively propose a qualitative interpretation in terms of a surface disturbance to the Keplerian flow, i.e., a disk eruption, driven by an embedded outflow launched by a {\textasciitilde}10 M earth body. Another interpretation involves a disk-mass-loading hot spot at the convergence of an envelope accretion streamer.},

Quantifying the flux of cosmic rays reaching exoplanets is important since cosmic rays are relevant in the context of life. Here, we calculate the Galactic cosmic ray fluxes in AU Mic and Prox Cen planetary systems. We propagate the Galactic cosmic rays using a 1D cosmic ray transport model. We find for Prox Cen b, AU Mic b and AU Mic c that the Galactic cosmic ray fluxes are strongly suppressed and are lower than the fluxes reaching Earth. We include in our models, for the first time for a star other than the Sun, the effect of radial particle drift due to gradients and curvatures in the stellar magnetic field. For Prox Cen we find that the inclusion of particle drift leads to less suppression of Galactic cosmic rays fluxes than when it is excluded from the model. In the case of AU Mic we explore two different wind environments, with a low and high stellar wind mass-loss rate. For AU Mic, the particle drift also leads to less suppression of the Galactic cosmic ray fluxes but it is only significant for the high mass-loss rate scenario. However, both wind scenarios for AU Mic suppress the Galactic cosmic rays strongly. Overall, careful modelling of stellar winds is needed to calculate the Galactic cosmic ray fluxes reaching exoplanets. The results found here can be used to interpret future exoplanet atmosphere observations and in atmospheric models.},

These flares exceed the luminosities of the largest solar flares by many orders of magnitude, which suggests that the underlying physical mechanisms supplying the energy are different from those on the Sun. Magnetic coupling between the components in a binary system or between a young star and an accretion disk has been proposed as a prerequisite for giant flares. Here we report X-ray observations of a giant flare on Algol B, a giant star in an eclipsing binary system. We observed a total X-ray eclipse of the flare, which demonstrates that the plasma was confined to Algol B, and reached a maximum height of 0.6 stellar radii above its surface. The flare occurred around the south pole of Algol B, and energy must have been released continuously throughout its life. We conclude that a specific extrastellar environment is not required for the presence of a flare, and that the processes at work are therefore similar to those on the Sun.},

By analysing optical-infrared colour time-series, we also find that the variability in the bursters is systematically less chromatic at all time-scales than the other variability types. We propose a model of YSO variability in which symmetric, bursting, and dipping behaviour is observed in systems viewed at low, intermediate, and high inclinations, respectively. We argue that the relatively short thermal time-scale for the disc can explain the fact that the infrared light curves for bursters are more symmetric than their optical counterparts, as the disc reprocesses the light from all rotational phases. From this model, we find that the accretion variability on to these YSOs roughly follows a random-walk.},

We find spot-modulated periods (P) for {\textasciitilde}90\% of members. The range of light curve and periodogram shapes echoes that found for other clusters with K2, but fewer multi-period stars may be an indication of different noise characteristics of TESS, or a result of the source selection methods here. The distribution of P as a function of color as a proxy for mass fits nicely in between that for both older and younger clusters observed by K2, with fast rotators found among both the highest and lowest masses probed here, and a well-organized distribution of M star rotation rates. About 13\% of the stars have an infrared (IR) excess, suggesting a circumstellar disk; this is well-matched to expectations, given the age of the stars. There is an obvious pile-up of disked M stars at P{\textasciitilde}2 days, and the pile-up may move to shorter P as the mass decreases. There is also a strong concentration of disk-free M stars at P{\textasciitilde}2 days, hinting that perhaps these stars have recently freed themselves from their disks. Exploring the rotation rates of stars in UCL/LCC has the potential to help us understand the beginning of the end of the influence of disks on rotation, and the timescale on which the star responds to unlocking.},

	abstract = {Recent advances in spectropolarimetry have allowed the reconstruction of stellar coronal magnetic fields. This uses Zeeman-Doppler magnetograms (ZDI) of the surface magnetic field as a lower boundary condition. The ZDI maps, however, suffer from the absence of information about the magnetic field over regions of the surface due to the presence of dark starspots and portions of the surface out of view due to a tilt in the rotation axis. They also suffer from finite resolution which leads to small-scale field structures being neglected. This paper explores the effects of this loss of information on the extrapolated coronal fields. For this, we use simulated stellar surface magnetic maps for two hypothetical stars. Using the potential field approximation, the coronal fields and emission measures are calculated. This is repeated for the cases of missing information due to, (i) starspots, (ii) a large area of the stellar surface out of view and (iii) a finite resolution. The largest effect on the magnetic field structure arises when a significant portion of the stellar surface remains out of view. This changes the nature of the field lines that connect to this obscured hemisphere. None the less, the field structure in the visible hemisphere is reliably reproduced. Thus, the calculation of the locations and surface filling factors of accretion funnels is reasonably well reproduced for the observed hemisphere. The decrease with height of the magnetic pressure, which is important in calculating disc truncation radii for accreting stars, is also largely unaffected in the equatorial plane. The fraction of surface flux that is open and therefore able to supply angular momentum loss in a wind, however, is often overestimated in the presence of missing flux. The magnitude and rotational modulation of the calculated emission measures is consistently decreased by the loss of magnetic flux in dark starspots. For very inactive stars, this may make it impossible to recover a magnetic cycle in the coronal emission. Finite resolution has little effect on those quantities, such as the emission measure and the average coronal electron density, that can currently be observed.},

Our numerical experiments showed that given high-resolution observations in four Stokes parameters the code is capable of reconstructing abundance and magnetic field vector distributions simultaneously and without any prior assumptions about the magnetic field geometry. At the same time we found that in order to achieve reliable reconstruction using only circular polarization data it is necessary to impose additional constraints on the possible structure of the magnetic field. Numerical tests also reveal surprisingly different properties of the MDI maps from conventional scalar maps which we attribute to the complex relation between the orientation of the field and the polarization signal. We conclude that the information about the field is primarily extracted from the changes in magnetic orientation due to rotation rather than from the Doppler shifts critical for scalar Doppler Imaging maps making it possible to apply the MDI to even very slow rotators.},

Two years later, an automatic tool (based on maximum entropy image reconstruction techniques) was developed and checked on a few test cases (Brown et al., 1991A\&amp;A...250..463B). In particular, this paper established that surface magnetic distributions consisting in circular regions of radially oriented field can be very well recovered with ZDI. In the present paper, we show new simulations demonstrating that ZDI is good at reconstructing the field orientation within magnetic regions. In particular, it can always unambiguously identify azimuthal from radial/meridional field features (where radial, azimuthal and meridional refer to the three vector field components in spherical geometry). For high latitude magnetic spots, all three field components can be recovered. For low latitude regions however, ZDI (from circular polarimetry alone) suffers some crosstalk from radial to meridional field components (or vice versa), especially at low stellar inclination angles.},

These maps suggest that the field topology of τ Sco is comprised of comparable contributions of the poloidal and toroidal magnetic components. At the same time, we also found that available Stokes V observations can be successfully fitted with restricted harmonic expansions, by either neglecting the toroidal field altogether, or linking the radial and horizontal components of the poloidal field as required by the widely used potential field extrapolation technique. These alternative modelling approaches lead to a stronger and topologically more complex surface field structure. The field distributions, which were recovered with different ZDI options, differ significantly and yield indistinguishable Stokes V profiles but different linear polarisation (Stokes Q and U) signatures. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our investigation underscores the well-known problem of non-uniqueness of the Stokes V ZDI inversions.

After an extensive observational campaign, we updated the prediction and it turned out to be favorable to central Europe. Therefore, we mobilized half a hundred professional and amateur astronomers, and the occultation was finally detected from 21 telescopes located at 18 sites. This makes the Huya event one of the best ever observed stellar occultation by a TNO in terms of the number of chords. We determine accurate size, shape, and geometric albedo, and we also provide constraints on the density and other internal properties of this TNO. The 21 positive detections of the occultation by Huya allowed us to obtain well-separated chords which permitted us to fit an ellipse for the limb of the body at the moment of the occultation (i.e., the instantaneous limb) with kilometric accuracy. The projected semi-major and minor axes of the best ellipse fit obtained using the occultation data are (a', b') = (217.6 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 3.5 km, 194.1 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 6.1 km) with a position angle of the minor axis P' = 55.2 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 9.1 degrees. From this fit, the projected area-equivalent diameter is 411.0 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 7.3 km. This diameter is compatible with the equivalent diameter for Huya obtained from radiometric techniques (D = 406 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 16 km). From this instantaneous limb, we obtained the geometric albedo for Huya (p\${\textbackslash}rm\_V\$ = 0.079 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.004) and we explored possible 3D shapes and constraints to the mass density for this TNO. We did not detect the satellite of Huya through this occultation, but the presence of rings or debris around Huya is constrained using the occultation data.

It is shown that the discrepancy between stratified and nonstratified loops is higher in density perturbations than in velocity perturbations. When the star has a larger mass, higher coronal temperature, and longer loop, the density perturbations in the stratified loop are significantly different from the harmonic functions. The periods in the stratified loop are slightly longer than in the nonstratified loop.

	abstract = {Advances in high-precision spectrographs have paved the way for the search for an Earth analogue orbiting a Sun-like star within its habitable zone. However, the research community remains limited by the presence of stellar noise produced by stellar magnetic activity. These activity phenomena can obscure the detection of Earth-mass exoplanets and can create parasitic signals in transmission spectra. In this paper, we outline the need for a public forecast of stellar activity and produce a proof of principle. Using publicly available spectra we are able to forecast stellar minima several years ahead and reach a typical uncertainty on the timing of these minima of \${\textbackslash}pm 0.5{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm yr\$, similar to the precision reached on our own Sun's magnetic cycle. Furthermore, we use our toy model to show that knowing when to observe can improve the sensitivity of HARPS-North's Solar telescope to low-mass planets by up to an order of magnitude, and we show that the majority of exoplanets selected for Early Release Science and Guaranteed Time Observations on the James Webb will be observed close or during stellar maxima, incurring a higher risk of stellar contamination. We finish our paper by outlining a number of next steps to create a public forecast usable by teams around the globe, by telescope time allocation committees, and in preparation for spacecraft such as Ariel.},

In this study, we use a three-dimensional (3-D) model to simulate conditions for a Venus-like exoplanet orbiting the M-dwarf type star GJ 436 by varying the star/planet distance and considering the resultant effects on heating/cooling and dynamics. The simulation includes the middle and upper atmosphere ({\textless}40 mbar). Overall, these model comparisons reveal that the impact of extreme ultraviolet to ultraviolet (EUV-UV) heating on the energy balance shows both radiative and dynamical processes are responsible for driving significant variations in zonal winds and global temperature profiles at {\textless} 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ mbar. More specifically, CO\$\_\{2\}\$ 15-\$\{{\textbackslash}mu\}\$m cooling balances EUV/UV and Near InfraRed (NIR) heating at altitudes below 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-7\}\$ mbar pressure with a strong maximum balance for pressures at {\textasciitilde}10\${\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$ mbar, thus explaining the invariance of the temperature distribution at altitudes below 10\${\textasciicircum}\{-5\}\$mbar pressure for all cases. Our model comparisons also show that moderate changes in NIR heating result in relatively small changes in neutral temperature in the upper atmosphere, and virtually no change in the middle atmosphere. However, with larger changes in the NIR heating profile, much greater changes in neutral temperature occur in the entire upper and middle atmosphere studied.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220510219C},
	abstract = {(Abridged) Exoplanetary research has provided us with exciting discoveries of planets around very low mass (VLM) stars (e.g., TRAPPIST-1 and Proxima Centauri). However, current theoretical models strive to explain planet formation in these conditions and do not predict the development of giant planets. Recent high-resolution observations from ALMA of the disk around CIDA 1, a VLM star in Taurus, show substructures hinting at the presence of a massive planet. We aim to reproduce the dust ring of CIDA 1, observed in the dust continuum emission in ALMA Band 7 (0.9 mm) and Band 4 (2.1 mm), along with its \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO (J=3-2) and \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO (J=3-2) channel maps, assuming the structures are shaped by the interaction of the disk with a massive planet. We seek to retrieve the mass and position of the putative planet. We model the protoplanetary disk with a set of hydrodynamical simulations, varying the mass and locations of the embedded planet. We compute the dust and gas emission using radiative transfer simulations, and, finally, we obtain the synthetic observations treating the images as the actual ALMA observations. Our models indicate that a planet with a minimum mass of \${\textbackslash}sim1.4{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{Jup\}\$ orbiting at a distance of \${\textbackslash}sim 9-10\$ au can explain the morphology and location of the observed dust ring at Band 7 and Band 4. We can reproduce the low spectral index (\${\textbackslash}sim 2\$) observed where the dust ring is detected. Our synthetic images reproduce the morphology of the \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$CO and \${\textasciicircum}\{13\}\$CO observed channel maps where the cloud absorption allowed a detection. Applying an empirical relation between planet mass and gap width in the dust, we predict a maximum planet mass of \${\textbackslash}sim4 - 8{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}text\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}text\{Jup\}\$. Our results suggest the presence of a massive planet orbiting CIDA 1, thus challenging our understanding of planet formation around VLM stars.},

V496 UMa displays a two-pole accretion geometry in the high accretion state.

Low-state ZTF and SDSS photometric data are consistent with an 0.8 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} white dwarf at 10 000 K and a main-sequence donor star with a spectral type of M5.0 at a Gaia determined distance of 758 pc. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: V496 UMa is a very bright polar in X-rays when it is in the high state. Due to its unusual geometric structure, mass accretion onto the second accretion pole is interrupted occasionally. This discontinuous behavior does not follow a certain pattern in time and has been observed so far only in the high state. The X-ray light curves display clear evidence of an accretion stream at the photometric phase of ϕ = 0.81, which does not show up in optical light curves.

	abstract = {Context. Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the primary driver of the exoplanetary space weather and they could affect the habitability of exoplanets. However, detections of possible stellar CME signatures are extremely rare. Aims. This work aims to detect stellar CMEs from time-domain spectra observed through the LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (LAMOST-MRS). Our sample includes 1,379,408 LAMOST-MRS spectra of 226,194 late-type main-sequence stars (\${\textbackslash}rm T\_\{eff\} {\textless} 6000\$ K, \${\textbackslash}rm log [g/(cm{\textbackslash} s{\textasciicircum}\{-2\})] {\textgreater} 4.0\$). Methods. We first identified stellar CME candidates by examining the asymmetries of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line profiles, and then performed double Gaussian fitting for H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ contrast profiles (differences between the CME spectra and reference spectra) of the CME candidates to analyze the temporal variation of the asymmetric components. Results. Three stellar CME candidates were detected on three M dwarfs. The H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and Mg I triplet lines (at 5168.94 Å, 5174.13 Å, 5185.10 Å) of candidate 1 all exhibit a blue-wing enhancement, and the corresponding Doppler shift of this enhancement shows a gradually increasing trend. The H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line also shows an obvious blue-wing enhancement in candidate 2. In candidate 3, the H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line shows an obvious red-wing enhancement, and the corresponding projected maximum velocity exceeds the surface escape velocity of the host star. The lower limit of the CME mass was estimated to be \${\textbackslash}sim\$\$8 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{17\}\$ g to \$4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{18\}\$ g for these three candidates.},

	abstract = {A long-term photometric monitoring of a selected sample of solar analogues has been carried out since early nineties as part of The Sun in time project, which is aimed at a multiwavelength study of stars with solar-like global properties, but with different ages and thus at different stages of their evolution. The extended time sequence of ground-based observations collected over more than a decade as part of this program has revealed the existence of starspot cycles. Also from these data it is possible to investigate surface differential rotation of the stars. In this paper we present the photometry collected to date and report on cycles search for a selected subsample of five young single G0-G5V stars with ages between ={\textasciitilde} 130 Myr and 700 Myr: {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}EK Dra{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}, {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}pi 1 UMa{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}, {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}HN Peg{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}, {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}k1 Cet{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} and {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}BE Cet{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}. Also we include in this study the Pleiades-age ( ={\textasciitilde} 130 Myr) K0V star {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}DX Leo{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} (HD 82443). All the cited stars show activity cycles whose period is, furthermore, the first determined from photometric data. They are compared to those activity cycles derived from CaII H\&amp;K emission fluxes and differences are discussed. All the cycle periods, except for EK Dra, fit well the empirical relations with global stellar parameters derived from larger stellar samples. The following results are also inferred from the present study: i) the fastest rotating stars tend to have longer cycles; ii) the range in the observed cycle lengths seems to converge with stellar age from a maximum dispersion around the Pleiades' age towards the solar cycle value at the Sun's age; iii) the overall short- and long-term photometric variability increases with inverse Rossby number with very high correlation degree, indicating that the level of magnetic activity at least in photosphere is still controlled by the stellar rotation even on the longest time scales; iiii) the increase with inverse Rossby number of the long-term overall photometric variability seems to level off at the highest rotation rate, which may be interpreted as due to a saturation in the level of photospheric magnetic activity around the activity maximum.},

These observations let us identify individual dark starspots on the stellar surfaces from periodic dimming of the starlight, follow the evolution of these spots, and search for long-term cyclic changes in the properties of these starspots that might reveal magnetic cycles analogous to the Sun's 11 yr sunspot cycle. We developed a computer code to fit a simple two-spot model to our observed light curves that allows us to extract the most easily determinable and most reliable spot parameters from the light curves, i.e., spot longitudes and radii. We then used these measured properties to identify individual spots and to chart their life histories by constructing migration and amplitude curves. We identified and followed 11 spots in lambda And, 16 in sigma Gem, 12 in II Peg, and 15 in V711 Tau. Lifetimes of individual spots ranged from a few months to longer than 6 yr. Differential rotation coefficients, estimated from the observed range of spot rotation periods for each star and defined by equation (2), were 0.04 for lambda And, 0.038 for sigma Gem, 0.005 for II Peg, and 0.006 for V711 Tau, versus 0.19 for the Sun. We searched for cyclic changes in mean brightness, B-V color index, and spot rotation period as evidence for long-term cycles. Of these, long-term variability in mean brightness appears to offer the best evidence for such cycles in these four stars. Cycles of 11.1 yr for lambda And, 8.5 yr for sigma Gem, 11 yr for II Peg, and 16 yr V711 Tau are implied by these mean brightness changes. Cyclic changes in spot rotation period were found in lambda And and possibly II Peg. Errors in B-V were too large for any long-term changes to be detectable.},

We applied a two-spot model with generalized Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram determined period of P = 4.436391 ± 0.00137 d to model chunks sliding over TESS light curve. We also measured the relative equivalent widths of Ca II H and K, Hβ and Hα emissions by subtracting the overall spectrum from individual spectra. It was found that a two-spot configuration, namely a primary, slowly evolving and long-lasting spot (P) plus a secondary, rapidly evolving spot (S), was capable of explaining the data, although the actual starspot distribution cannot be derived from the collected data. Despite the spot radius-latitude degeneracy revealed in the best-fitting solutions, a sudden alternation between P and S radii followed by a gradual decrease of S in T1 and a decrease of both P and S from T1 to T2 were significant, corresponding to the evolution of magnetic activity. In addition, S revealed rotation and an oscillatory longitude migration synchronized to P in T1, but had a much larger migration than P in T2. This might indicate the evolution of the internal magnetic configuration. Chromospheric activity indicators were found to be tightly correlated with each other and revealed rotational modulation as well as a long-term decrease of emissions, implying the existence and evolution of magnetic activity on HD 134319.},

The effect of stellar activity on radial velocity (RV) measurements appears to be a limiting factor in detecting Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of a star that is similar to the Sun in spectral type and activity level. It is crucial to estimate whether this conclusion remain true for other stars with current correction methods. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We built realistic time series in radial velocity and chromospheric emission for old main-sequence F6-K4 stars. We studied the effect of the stellar parameters we investigate on exoplanet detectability. The stellar parameters are spectral type, activity level, rotation period, cycle period and amplitude, latitude coverage, and spot constrast, which we chose to be in ranges that are compatible with our current knowledge of stellar activity. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: This very large set of synthetic time series allowed us to study the effect of the parameters on the RV jitter and how the different contributions to the RV are affected in this first analysis of the data set. The RV jitter was used to provide a first-order detection limit for each time series and different temporal samplings. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find that the coverage in latitude of the activity pattern and the cycle amplitudes have a strong effect on the RV jitter, as has stellar inclination.

Finally, we show that based on the RV jitter that is associated with each time series and using a simple criterion, a planet with one Earth mass and a period of one to two years probably cannot be detected with current analysis techniques, except for the lower mass stars in our sample, but very many observations would be required. The effect of inclination is critical. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The results are very important in the context of future RV follow-ups of transit detections of such planets. We conclude that a significant improvement of analysis techniques and/or observing strategies must be made to reach such low detection limits.},

The sample is mainly composed of low-activity, main-sequence late-A to mid-M-type stars. We performed a search for short (days) and long-term (years) periodic variations in the photometry. We modelled the light curves with combinations of sinusoids to measure the properties of these periodic signals. To provide a better statistical interpretation of our results, we complement our new results with results from previous similar works. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We have been able to measure long-term photometric cycles of 47 stars, out of which 39 have been derived with false alarm probabilities (FAP) of less than 0.1 per cent. Rotational modulation was also detected and rotational periods were measured in 36 stars. For 28 stars we have simultaneous measurements of activity cycles and rotational periods, 17 of which are M-type stars. We measured both photometric amplitudes and periods from sinusoidal fits. The measured cycle periods range from 2 to 14 yr with photometric amplitudes in the range of 5-20 mmag. We found that the distribution of cycle lengths for the different spectral types is similar, as the mean cycle is 9.5 yr for F-type stars, 6.7 yr for G-type stars, 8.5 yr for K-type stars, 6.0 yr for early M-type stars, and 7.1 yr for mid-M-type stars. On the other hand, the distribution of rotation periods is completely different, trending to longer periods for later type stars, from a mean rotation of 8.6 days for F-type stars to 85.4 days in mid-M-type stars. The amplitudes induced by magnetic cycles and rotation show a clear correlation. A trend of photometric amplitudes with rotation period is also outlined in the data. The amplitudes of the photometric variability induced by activity cycles of main-sequence GK stars are lower than those of early- and mid-M dwarfs for a given activity index.

	abstract = {We report the detection of a large-scale magnetic field at the surface of the slowly rotating fully convective (FC) M dwarf Proxima Centauri. 10 circular polarization spectra, collected from 2017 April to July with the HARPS-Pol spectropolarimeter, exhibit rotationally modulated Zeeman signatures suggesting a stellar rotation period of 89.8 ± 4.0 d. Using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, we invert the circular polarization spectra into a surface distribution of the large-scale magnetic field. We find that Proxima Cen hosts a large-scale magnetic field of typical strength 200 G, whose topology is mainly poloidal, and moderately axisymmetric, featuring, in particular, a dipole component of 135 G tilted at 51° to the rotation axis. The large-scale magnetic flux is roughly 3× smaller than the flux measured from the Zeeman broadening of unpolarized lines, which suggests that the underlying dynamo is efficient at generating a magnetic field at the largest spatial scales. Our observations occur ∼1 yr after the maximum of the reported 7 yr-activity cycle of Proxima Cen, which opens the door for the first long-term study of how the large-scale field evolves with the magnetic cycle in an FC very low mass star. Finally, we find that Proxima Cen's habitable zone planet, Proxima-b, is likely orbiting outside the Alfvèn surface, where no direct magnetic star-planet interactions occur.},

	abstract = {The stellar magnetic field plays a crucial role in the star internal mechanisms, as in the interactions with its environment. The study of starspots provides information about the stellar magnetic field and can characterize the cycle. Moreover, the analysis of solar-type stars is also useful to shed light onto the origin of the solar magnetic field. The objective of this work is to characterize the magnetic activity of stars. Here, we studied two solar-type stars, Kepler-17 and Kepler-63, using two methods to estimate the magnetic cycle length. The first one characterizes the spots (radius, intensity, and location) by fitting the small variations in the light curve of a star caused by the occultation of a spot during a planetary transit. This approach yields the number of spots present in the stellar surface and the flux deficit subtracted from the star by their presence during each transit. The second method estimates the activity from the excess in the residuals of the transit light curves. This excess is obtained by subtracting a spotless model transit from the light curve and then integrating all the residuals during the transit. The presence of long-term periodicity is estimated in both time series. With the first method, we obtained P cycle = 1.12 ± 0.16 year (Kepler-17) and P cycle = 1.27 ± 0.16 year (Kepler-63), and for the second approach the values are 1.35 ± 0.27 year and 1.27 ± 0.12 year, respectively. The results of both methods agree with each other and confirm their robustness.},

	abstract = {Stellar coronal activity has been shown to persist into the low-mass star regime, down to late M-dwarf spectral types. However, there is now an accumulation of evidence suggesting that at the end of the main sequence, there is a transition in the nature of the magnetic activity from chromospheric and coronal to planet-like and auroral, from local impulsive heating via flares and MHD wave dissipation to energy dissipation from strong large-scale magnetospheric current systems. We examine this transition and the prevalence of auroral activity in brown dwarfs through a compilation of multiwavelength surveys of magnetic activity, including radio, X-ray, and optical. We compile the results of those surveys and place their conclusions in the context of auroral emission as a consequence of large-scale magnetospheric current systems that accelerate energetic electron beams and drive the particles to impact the cool atmospheric gas. We explore the different manifestations of auroral phenomena, like Hα, in brown dwarf atmospheres and define their distinguishing characteristics. We conclude that large-amplitude photometric variability in the near-infrared is most likely a consequence of clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres, but that auroral activity may be responsible for long-lived stable surface features. We report a connection between auroral Hα emission and quiescent radio emission in electron cyclotron maser instability pulsing brown dwarfs, suggesting a potential underlying physical connection between quiescent and auroral emissions. We also discuss the electrodynamic engines powering brown dwarf aurorae and the possible role of satellites around these systems both to power the aurorae and seed the magnetosphere with plasma.},

We start from a recent observational analysis of the problem undertaken by Berdyugina \&amp; Usoskin (2003, A\&amp;A, 405, 1121) and Usoskin et al. (2005, A\&amp;A, 441, 347) who demonstrated from a study of sunspot data that solar active longitudes rotate differentially, with a small but significant asynchrony between northern and southern hemispheres. We suggest two concepts by which the underlying magnetic structure could lead to the observed phenomenology - the true differential rotation of a nonaxisymmetric magnetic structure and a stroboscopic effect. In the latter case, a solid body rotation of nonaxisymmetric magnetic structure is illuminated by an activity wave propagating from middle latitudes to the solar equator, and so mimics a differential rotation. We then discuss several mechanisms which could in principle lead to the excitation of active longitudes. In particular, we consider dynamo excitation of nonaxisymmetric magnetic modes, nonaxisymmetric structures as a manifestation of a relic magnetic field in the solar core, nonaxisymmetric solar hydrodynamics and nonlinear instabilities that lack axial symmetry. We conclude that these mechanisms all provide ways to explain the phenomenology, provided the stroboscopic interpretation is accepted. Of course, a quantitative explanation in the framework of any scenario requires ultimately a detailed numerical simulation. The interpretation of the available observations as a true differential rotation appears to provide a much more severe challenge for theorists. We are unable to suggest a plausible mechanism of this kind; however we can not exclude in principle such an explanation. We relate the phenomenon of solar active longitudes to the information available concerning stellar active longitudes, and also consider evidence from other tracers of solar activity.},

The large-scale pattern of flux emergence our simulations produce exhibits preferred longitudinal modes of low order, drift with respect to a fixed reference system, and alignment across the equator at low latitudes between ±15°. We suggest that these active-longitude-like emergence patterns are the result of columnar, rotationally aligned giant cells present in our convection simulation at low latitudes. If giant convecting cells exist in the bulk of the solar convection zone, this phenomenon, along with differential rotation, could in part provide an explanation for the behavior of active longitudes.},

The flares occurred every {\textasciitilde}20 hr and showed an exponential decay with time constant 30-60 ks. The X-ray spectra are explained by a thin thermal plasma emission. The plasma temperature shows a fast rise and slow decay for each flare with kTpeak{\textasciitilde}4-6 keV. The emission measure of the plasma shows this time profile only for the first flare, and remains almost constant during the second and third flares, at the level of the tail of the first flare. The peak flare luminosities, LX,peak, were {\textasciitilde}5-20x1031 ergs s-1, which are among the brightest X-ray luminosities observed to date for class I protostars. The total energy released in each flare was 3-6x1036 ergs. The first flare is well reproduced by the quasi-static cooling model, which is based on solar flares, and it suggests that the plasma cools mainly radiatively, confined by a semicircular magnetic loop of length {\textasciitilde}14 Rsolar, with diameter-to-length ratio {\textasciitilde}0.07. The two subsequent flares were consistent with the reheating of the same magnetic structure as in the first flare. The large-scale magnetic structure and the periodicity of the flares imply that the reheating events of the same magnetic loop originate in an interaction between the star and the disk due to the differential rotation.},

Such a nest is a sequence of sunspot groups that appear within a small area on the solar surface and that last for several months. The search procedure is described and data for 41 probable sunspot nests are given. At least three quarters of these nests appear to be real, and not chance clusters. The nests are the same type of activity sequences as the ‘Fleckenherde’ discovered by Becker (1955) and the complexes of activity pointed out by Gaizauskas et al. (1983). The complexes of activity as defined by Bumba and Howard (1965) are different patterns, however; the relation between complexes and the nests is shown. Some properties of the nests are: (i) many nests appear as double structures; (ii) single nests and components of double nests are quite compact: the effective areas are comparable to those of medium-large sunspot groups; (iii) each nest rotates at its own steady rate about the Sun; (iv) the intrinsic scatter in the rotation rates is much larger than the trend in the differential rotation; (v) displacements in latitude are less than a few meters per second; (vi) many nests live for 6 to 15 Carrington rotation periods, the minimum lifetime is not yet determined; (vii) the fraction of the sunspot groups that are members of nests is large (at least 30\%).},

	abstract = {Solar magnetograms covering a period of years were used to study the distribution of weak magnetic fields on the solar surface. The semiregular pattern of these background fields is the result of the expansion, weakening, and stretching by differential rotation of magnetic fields of old active regions and their interaction with neighboring fields, and of the continuing development of magnetic fields of new regions within the pattern. The net result is a slowly changing pattern of background fields which occupies at times during the solar cycle more than 50 per cent of the surface area of the Sun, as seen with the 23" resolution of the magnetograph. The interaction of nearby magnetic fields takes the form of the apparent attraction of features of the same polarity and the apparent repulsion of features of opposite polarity. Sometimes weak magnetic features covering a large area apparently disappear over a period of a few rotations. It is not clear from the observations what the mechanism of this disappearance could be. It is clear from the period near minimum that active regions are concentrated in complexes of activity whose location and development are clearly defined. The largest of these complexes, consisting of many active regions, result in the formation of Unipolar Magnetic Regions (UMR). The polar fields are discussed from the standpoint of the poleward drift of the UMR's.},

Using spectral analysis of synoptic maps of photospheric magnetic fields, in addition to constructing maps of the surface distribution of activity, we find that the origin of the 27.03-day signal is long-lived complexes of active regions in the northern hemisphere at a latitude of approximately 18 deg. In addition, using a new time series analysis technique which utilizes the phase variance of a signal, the coherency of the 27.03-day period signal is found to be significant for the past two decades. However, using the past 120 years of the sunspot number time series, the 27.03-day period signal is found to be a short-lived, no longer than two 11-year solar cycles, quasi-stationary signal.},

	abstract = {In recent years, Zeeman Doppler imaging of rapidly rotating solar-like stars has shown high-latitude magnetic flux patterns of intermingled magnetic polarities. Such high-latitude intermingling of positive and negative flux is inconsistent with our present understanding of how magnetic flux emerges on the Sun and is transported poleward. To determine how these patterns may arise, magnetic flux transport simulations are carried out. These simulations follow the evolution of the radial magnetic field at the surface of the star as new magnetic bipoles emerge and are advected poleward by the surface effects of differential rotation, meridional flow and supergranular diffusion. To produce intermingling of flux at high latitudes, key parameters such as the emergence profiles and transport coefficients are varied from presently used solar values. In doing so, it is found that, in order to explain the high-latitude intermingling, at least two of these parameters must be changed. First, the emergence profile must be extended to higher latitudes (λ= 50°-70°), and secondly the value of the meridional flow must be increased by around a factor of 10 ({\textasciitilde}100 m s-1). The results show that the observed intermingling of high-latitude flux can only occur through a flux emergence and transport process that is significantly different from that which occurs on the Sun. Observable features produced by both of these changes are considered, and the significance of the simulations to future observing programmes discussed. Finally the emergence profile and transport coefficients that best fit the observations of the young active star AB Dor (period = 0.514 d) are put forward.},

	abstract = {Observations of the T Tauri spectroscopic binary DQ Tau in April 2008 captured an unusual flare at 3 mm, which peaked at an observed maximum flux of 0.5 Jy (about 27 times the quiescent value). Here we present follow-up millimeter observations that demonstrate a periodicity to the phenomenon. While monitoring 3 new periastron encounters, we have detected flares within 17.5 h (or 4.6\%) of the orbital phase of the first reported flare and constrained the main emitting region to a stellar height of 3.7-6.8 R\_star. The recorded activity is consistent with the proposed picture for synchrotron emission initiated by a magnetic reconnection event when the two stellar magnetospheres of the highly eccentric (e = 0.556) binary are believed to collide near periastron as the stars approach a minimum separation of 8 R\_star ( 13 R\_⊙). The similar light curve decay profiles allow us to estimate an average flare duration of 30 h. Assuming one millimeter flare per orbit, DQ Tau could spend approximately 8\% of its 15.8-day orbital period in an elevated flux state. These findings continue to serve as a small caution for millimeter flux points in spectral energy distributions that could contain unrecognized flare contributions. Our analysis of the millimeter emission provides an upper limit of 5\% on the linear polarization. We discuss the extent to which a severely entangled magnetic field structure and Faraday rotation effects are likely to reduce the observed polarization fraction. We also predict that, for the current picture, the stellar magnetospheres must be misaligned at a significant angle or, alternatively, that the topologies of the outer magnetospheres are poorly described by a well-ordered dipole inside a radius of 7 R\_star. Finally, to investigate whether reorganization of the magnetic field during the interaction affects mass accretion, we also present simultaneous optical (VRI) monitoring of the binary, as an established tracer of accretion activity in this system. We find that an accretion event can occur coincident in both time and duration with the synchrotron fallout of a magnetic reconnection event. While the pulsed accretion mechanism has been attributed previously to the dynamical motions of the stars alone, the similarities between the millimeter and optical light curves evoke the possibility of a causal or co-dependent relationship between the magnetospheric and dynamical processes. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendices are only available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In this paper, we show how tomographic imaging (Zeeman–Doppler imaging, ZDI) can be used to characterize stellar activity and magnetic field topologies, ultimately allowing us to filter out the radial velocity (RV) activity jitter of M dwarf moderate rotators. This work is based on spectropolarimetric observations of a sample of five weakly active early-M dwarfs (GJ 205, GJ 358, GJ 410, GJ 479, GJ 846) with HARPS-Pol and NARVAL. These stars have v sin i and RV jitters in the range 1–2 km s−1 and 2.7–10.0 m s−1 rms, respectively. Using a modified version of ZDI applied to sets of phase-resolved least-squares deconvolved profiles of unpolarized spectral lines, we are able to characterize the distribution of active regions at the stellar surfaces. We find that dark spots cover less than 2 per cent of the total surface of the stars of our sample. Our technique is efficient at modelling the rotationally modulated component of the activity jitter, and succeeds at decreasing the amplitude of this component by typical factors of 2–3 and up to 6 in optimal cases. From the rotationally modulated time series of circularly polarized spectra and with ZDI, we also reconstruct the large-scale magnetic field topology. These fields suggest that bistability of dynamo processes observed in active M dwarfs may also be at work for moderately active M dwarfs. Comparing spot distributions with field topologies suggest that dark spots causing activity jitter concentrate at the magnetic pole and/or equator, to be confirmed with future data on a larger sample.},

Here, we report on six precise spectroscopic Magellan/IMACS observations, five of which target the full optical window from 0.45 to 0.9 μm and one targeting the 0.4-0.55 μm blue-optical range. Five of these data sets are consistent with a transmission spectrum without any significant spectral features, while one shows a significant slope as a function of wavelength, which we interpret as arising from photospheric heterogeneities in the star. Coupled with HST/WFC3 infrared observations, our optical/near-infrared measurements point to the presence of high altitude clouds in WASP-19b's atmosphere in agreement with previous studies. Using a semi-analytical retrieval approach, considering both planetary and stellar spectral features, we find a water abundance consistent with solar for WASP-19b and strong evidence for sub-solar abundances for optical absorbers such as TiO and Na; no strong optical slope is detected, which suggests that if hazes are present, they are much weaker than previously suggested. In addition, two spot-crossing events are observed in our data sets and analysed, including one of the first unambiguously detected bright-spot-crossing events on an exoplanet host star.},

In total, we detect 34 individual starspot occultation events, caused by five different starspots, occulted in up to five consecutive transits or after a full stellar rotation. The longest recurring set of recurring starspot occultations spans over three stellar rotations, setting a lower limit for the longest starspot lifetime of 58 d. Starspot analysis provided a robust stellar rotational period measurement of 18.0 ± 0.2 d and indicates that the system is aligned, having a sky-projected obliquity of 0° ± 8°. A pronounced rotational modulation in the light curve has a period of 18.2 ± 1.6 d, in agreement with the rotational period derived from the starspot occultations. We tentatively detect an ellipsoidal modulation in the phase curve, with a semi-amplitude of 18 ppm, but cannot exclude the possibility that this is the result of red noise or imperfect removal of the rotational modulation. We detect no transit-timing and transit-duration variations with upper limits of 15 s and 1 min, respectively. We also reject any additional transiting planets with transit depths above 280 ppm in the orbital period region 0.5-30 d.},

	abstract = {The Qatar-2 transiting exoplanet system was recently observed in short-cadence mode by Kepler as part of K2 Campaign 6. We identify dozens of starspot-crossing events, when the planet eclipses a relatively dark region of the stellar photosphere. The observed patterns of these events demonstrate that the planet always transits over the same range of stellar latitudes and, therefore, that the stellar obliquity is less than about 10°. We support this conclusion with two different modeling approaches: one based on explicit identification and timing of the events and the other based on fitting the light curves with a spotted-star model. We refine the transit parameters and measure the stellar rotation period (18.5 ± 1.9 days), which corresponds to a “gyrochronological” age of 1.4 ± 0.3 Gyr. Coherent flux variations with the same period as the transits are well modeled as the combined effects of ellipsoidal light variations (15.4 ± 4.8 ppm) and Doppler boosting (14.6 ± 5.1 ppm). The magnitudes of these effects correspond to a planetary mass of 2.6+/- 0.9 \{M\}\{Jup\} and 3.9+/- 1.5 \{M\}\{Jup\}, respectively. Both of these independent mass estimates agree with the mass determined by the spectroscopic Doppler technique (2.487+/- 0.086 \{M\}\{Jup\}). No occultations are detected, giving a 2σ upper limit of 0.06 on the planet’s visual geometric albedo. We find no evidence for orbital decay, although we are only able to place a weak lower bound on the relevant tidal quality factor: \{Q\}{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}prime {\textgreater} 1.5× \{10\}4 (95\% confidence).},

Here I present ∼4.75 GHz Arecibo radio telescope observations of HD 189733 during a fraction of the exoplanet orbital phase range previously associated with enhanced coronal X-ray flaring. No radio flares from the lower corona were detected. I also leverage Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars, Automated Photoelectric Telescope, and Wise photometry to measure the occurrences of minima associated with enhanced starspot activity. The phasing of these minima with the exoplanet orbit does not reveal any synchronized active region behavior. Moreover, for the first time, I combine X-ray, ultraviolet, photometric, Ca II H and K, Hα, and radio observations of HD 189733 to conduct an extensive, holistic reexamination of stellar activity in this system. Through the presentation of new data, and by merging physical and statistical analytic approaches, I demonstrate that the previously asserted enhancements in activity, allegedly synchronized to certain exoplanet orbital phases, are likely the result of inadequately sampled intrinsic stellar activity from an active star, rather than star-planet interactions.},

	abstract = {The evolution of active regions (AR) from their emergence through their long decay process is of fundamental importance in solar physics. Since large-scale flux is generated by the deep-seated dynamo, the observed characteristics of flux emergence and that of the subsequent decay provide vital clues as well as boundary conditions for dynamo models. Throughout their evolution, ARs are centres of magnetic activity, with the level and type of activity phenomena being dependent on the evolutionary stage of the AR. As new flux emerges into a pre-existing magnetic environment, its evolution leads to re-configuration of small-and large-scale magnetic connectivities. The decay process of ARs spreads the once-concentrated magnetic flux over an ever-increasing area. Though most of the flux disappears through small-scale cancellation processes, it is the remnant of large-scale AR fields that is able to reverse the polarity of the poles and build up new polar fields. In this Living Review the emphasis is put on what we have learned from observations, which is put in the context of modelling and simulation efforts when interpreting them. For another, modelling-focused Living Review on the sub-surface evolution and emergence of magnetic flux see Fan (2009). In this first version we focus on the evolution of dominantly bipolar ARs.},

We updated the flare detection method from our previous studies by using a high-pass filter to remove rotational variations caused by starspots. We also examined the sample biases on the frequency of superflares, taking into account gyrochronology and flare detection completeness. The sample sizes of solar-type and Sun-like stars (effective temperature is 5600-6000 K and rotation period is over 20 days in solar-type stars) are ∼4 and ∼12 times, respectively, compared with Notsu et al. As a result, we found 2341 superflares on 265 solar-type stars and 26 superflares on 15 Sun-like stars; the former increased from 527 to 2341 and the latter from three to 26 events compared with our previous study. This enabled us to have a more well-established view on the statistical properties of superflares. The observed upper limit of the flare energy decreases as the rotation period increases in solar-type stars. The frequency of superflares decreases as the stellar rotation period increases. The maximum energy we found on Sun-like stars is 4 × 1034 erg. Our analysis of Sun-like stars suggests that the Sun can cause superflares with energies of ∼7 × 1033 erg (∼X700-class flares) and ∼1 × 1034 erg (∼X1000-class flares) once every ∼3000 and ∼6000 yr, respectively.},

	abstract = {We present models designed to quantify the effects of stellar activity on exoplanet transit spectroscopy and atmospheric characterization at low (R = 100) and high (R = 100,000) spectral resolution. We study three model classes mirroring planetary system archetypes: a hot Jupiter around an early-K star (HD 189733 b); a mini-Neptune around an early-M dwarf (K2-18 b); and terrestrial planets around a late-M dwarf (TRAPPIST-1). We map photospheres with temperatures and radial velocities (RV) and integrate specific intensity stellar models. We obtain transit spectra affected by stellar contamination, the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (RME), and center-to-limb variations (CLV). We find that, at low resolution, for later-type stars, planetary water features become difficult to distinguish from contamination. Many distributions of unocculted active regions can induce planetary-like features of similar amplitudes in the case of a late-M dwarf. Atmospheric characterization of planets around late-type stars will likely continue to suffer from degeneracy with stellar activity unless active regions' parameters can be constrained using additional information. For the early-K star, stellar contamination mostly manifests itself through a slope at optical wavelengths similar to Rayleigh scattering. In all cases, contamination induces offsets in measured planet radii. At high resolution, we show that we can determine the origin of H2O and CO detection signals and lift the degeneracy observed at low resolution, provided sufficient planet RV variation during transit and adequate correction for the RME and CLV when required. High-resolution spectroscopy may therefore help resolve issues arising from stellar contamination for favorable systems.},

	abstract = {High energy X-ray and ultraviolet (UV) radiation from young stars impacts planetary atmospheric chemistry and mass loss. The active {\textasciitilde}22 Myr M dwarf AU Mic hosts two exoplanets orbiting interior to its debris disk. Therefore, this system provides a unique opportunity to quantify the effects of stellar XUV irradiation on planetary atmospheres as a function of both age and orbital separation. In this paper we present over 5 hours of Far-UV (FUV) observations of AU Mic taken with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS; 1070-1360 Angstrom) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We provide an itemization of \$176\$ emission features in the HST/COS FUV spectrum and quantify the flux contributions from formation temperatures ranging from \$10{\textasciicircum}4-10{\textasciicircum}7\$ K. We detect 13 flares in the FUV white-light curve with energies ranging from \$10{\textasciicircum}\{29\} - 10{\textasciicircum}\{31\}\$ ergs. The majority of the energy in each of these flares is released from the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona. There is a 100x increase in flux at continuum wavelengths \${\textbackslash}lambda {\textless} 1100\$ Angstrom, in each flare which may be caused by thermal Bremsstrahlung emission. We calculate that the baseline atmospheric mass-loss rate for AU Mic b, is \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ g s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, although this rate can be as high as \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{14\}\$ g s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ during flares with \$L\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{flare\} {\textbackslash}simeq 10{\textasciicircum}\{33\}\$ erg s\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. Finally, we model the transmission spectra for AU Mic b and c with a new panchromatic spectrum of AU Mic and motivate future JWST observations of these planets.},

So far, the group has visually surveyed nearly 10 million light curves and authored 69 peer-reviewed papers which mainly focus on exoplanets and discoveries involving multistellar systems found using the transit method. The preferred manual search-method carried out by the VSG has revealed its strength by detecting numerous sub-stellar objects which were overlooked or discarded by automated search programs, uncovering some of the most rare stars in our galaxy, and leading to several serendipitous discoveries of unprecedented astrophysical phenomena. The main purpose of the VSG is to assist in the exploration of our local Universe, and we therefore advocate continued crowd-sourced examination of time-domain data sets, and invite other research teams to reach out in order to establish collaborating projects.},

	abstract = {In coronal loop modeling, it is commonly assumed that the loops are semicircular with a uniform cross-sectional area. However, observed loops are rarely semicircular, and extrapolations of the magnetic field show that the field strength decreases with height, implying that the cross-sectional area expands with height. We examine these two assumptions directly, to understand how they affect the hydrodynamic and radiative response of short, hot loops to strong, impulsive electron beam heating events. Both the magnitude and rate of area expansion impact the dynamics directly, and an expanding cross section significantly lengthens the time for a loop to cool and drain, increases upflow durations, and suppresses sound waves. The standard T {\textasciitilde} n 2 relation for radiative cooling does not hold with expanding loops, which cool with relatively little draining. An increase in the eccentricity of loops, on the other hand, only increases the draining timescale, and is a minor effect in general. Spectral line intensities are also strongly impacted by the variation in the cross-sectional area because they depend on both the volume of the emitting region as well as the density and ionization state. With a larger expansion, the density is reduced, so the lines at all heights are relatively reduced in intensity, and because of the increase of cooling times, the hottest lines remain bright for significantly longer. Area expansion is critical to accurate modeling of the hydrodynamics and radiation, and observations are needed to constrain the magnitude, rate, and location of the expansion-or lack thereof.},

	abstract = {We present the results of an intensive coordinated monitoring campaign in the optical and X-ray wavelength ranges of the low-mass, pre-main sequence star V410 Tau carried out in November 2001. The aim of this project was to study the relation between various indicators for magnetic activity that probe different emitting regions and would allow us to obtain clues on the interplay of the different atmospheric layers: optical photometric star spot (rotation) cycle, chromospheric Hα emission, and coronal X-rays. Our optical photometric monitoring has allowed us to measure the time of the minimum of the lightcurve with high precision. Joining the result with previous data we provide a new estimate for the dominant periodicity of V410 Tau (1.871970 +/- 0.000010 d). This updated value removes systematic offsets of the time of minimum observed in data taken over the last decade. The recurrence of the minimum in the optical lightcurve over such a long timescale emphasizes the extraordinary stability of the largest spot. This is confirmed by radial velocity measurements: data from 1993 and 2001 fit almost exactly onto each other when folded with the new period. The combination of the new data from November 2001 with published measurements taken during the last decade allows us to examine long-term changes in the mean light level of the photometry of V410 Tau. A variation on the timescale of 5.4 yr is suggested. Assuming that this behavior is truly cyclic V410 Tau is the first pre-main sequence star on which an activity cycle is detected. Two X-ray pointings were carried out with the Chandra satellite simultaneously with the optical observations, and centered near the maximum and minimum levels of the optical lightcurve. A relation of their different count levels to the rotation period of the dominating spot is not confirmed by a third Chandra observation carried out some months later, during another minimum of the 1.87 d cycle. Similarly we find no indications for a correlation of the Hα emission with the spots' rotational phase. The lack of detected rotational modulation in two important activity diagnostics seems to argue against a direct association of chromospheric and coronal emission with the spot distribution.},

However, existing tests have relied on flaring rates in active regions being constant in time, or else have attempted to model the rate variation, which is a difficult task. A simple test is described which is independent of flaring rates. The test generalizes the approach of L. Fritzová-Švestkova, R.C. Chase, and Z. Švestka [Solar Phys. 48, 275, 1976], and examines the distribution of flare coincidences in pairs of active regions as a function of coincidence interval τ. The test is applied to available soft X-ray and Hα flare event listings. The soft X-ray events exhibit a deficit of flare coincidences for τ≤;20 min, which is most likely due to an event-selection effect whereby the increased soft X-ray emission due to one flare prevents a second flare being identified. The Hα events show an excess of flare coincidences for τ≤; 10 min, suggesting flare sympathy. The number of Hα event pairs occurring within 10 min of one another is higher than that expected on the basis of random coincidence by a fraction 0.12± 0.02. Nearby active regions (spatial separation {\textless}50˚) show a greater excess of coincidences for τ≤; 10 min than do active regions which are far apart (spatial separation ≥50˚). However, the active regions which are far apart still show some evidence for an excess of coincidences at very short coincidence intervals (τ≤; 2 min), which appears to exclude the possibility of a coronal disturbance propagating from one region to another.},

We present the characteristics of four of them (June 4, 6, 9, 15). Precise measurements of the spot motions from Debrecen and Tokyo white-light pictures are used to understand the fragmentation of the main sunspot group with time. This fragmentation leads to a continuous restructuring of the magnetic field pattern while rapid changes are evidenced due to fast new flux emergence (magnetograms of MFSC, Huairou). The first process leads to a shearing of the field lines along which there is energy storage; the second one is the trigger which causes the release of energy by creating a complex topology. We conjecture that these two processes with different time scales are relevant to the production of flares.},

	abstract = {The problem of physical relationships between different active regions has been dealt with only rarely and mainly in connection with flares. How sympathetic activity can be triggered between distant regions is therefore, so far, largely unknown. Soft X-ray images of large-scale coronal structures connecting different active regions were obtained by Skylab nearly 20 years ago, while SMM, more recently, did not provide any clear evidence for this kind of loop. As a consequence, we do not know how common these features are nor how they form nor whether they represent the only means by which distant active regions may be linked. In the latter case, however, interconnecting loops should be detected by analyzing the interaction between different active regions. We examine here a set of images of an active region complex, acquired on June 24-25, 1980, by the Hard X-ray Imaging Spectrometer on SMM, with the purpose of establishing whether there was any interplay between the frequent activity observed at different sites in the activity center and, in such a case, how the interaction was established. By analyzing both quiet and active orbits we show that, as a rule, activity originating in one region triggers the other region's activity. However, we find little unambiguous evidence for the presence of large-scale interconnecting loops. A comparison of X-ray images with magnetic field observations suggested that we interpret the active region behavior in terms of the interaction between different loop systems, in a scenario quite analogous to the interacting bipole representation of individual flares. We conclude that active region interplay provides an easily observable case to study the time-dependent topology and the mechanisms for the spreading of activity in transient events over all energy scales.},

The compression of the magnetic field during the collapse results in forces which stop the collapse, in a time comparable to the rise time of flare light curves. Turbulence is likely to occur if the velocities of collapse become comparable to Alfv6n speeds. If turbulence occurs, it can cause sufficient Ohmic dissipation of the magnetic fields to explain the rate of optical emission (Wentzel, Astron. J. 68, 299(A), 1963). The dissipation and emission are localized in thin surfaces at eddy boundaries. The total depth of the emitting surfaces crossed by a line of sight through the flare is of the order of 10 km, in agreement with inferences from observations (Suemoto, Hiei, and Hirayama, J. Phys.

The result is heating, with attendant favorable conditions for the generation of radio, x-ray, and particle events, instead of an optical flare. Depending on the extent of the collapsing region, optical and heating events may occur alone or together. The conditions under which turbulence may occur and the corresponding gas densities have been investigated numerically. Some of the consequences of the theory relate to flare heights and light curves, increases in density before optical flaring starts, rates of expansion of flare areas, homologous flares, and apparently simultaneous flares.},

The X-ray photographs were compared with Hα observations of flares, sudden filament disappearances, sprays and loop prominence systems (LPS). Eighty-one percent of the X-ray events were correlated with Hα filament activity, but only forty-four percent were correlated with reported Hα flares. The X-ray enhancements took the form of loops or arcades of loops ranging in length from 60 000 km to 520 000 km and averaging 15 000 km in width. Lifetimes ranged from ≥3 hr to {\textgreater}24 hr. Event frequency was ∼1.4 per day. X-ray loop arcades evolved from sharp-edged clouds in cavities vacated by rising Hα filaments. Expansion velocities of the loops were ∼50 km s-1 immediately after excitation and 1 10 km s-1 several hours later. These long-lived loop arcades are identified with LPS, and it is suggested that the loops outlined magnetic fields which were reconnecting after filament eruptions. Another class of X-ray enhanced loops stretched outside active regions and accompanied sprays or lateral filament ejections. Hα brightenings occurred where these loops intersected the chromosphere. Inferred excitation velocities along the loops ranged between ∼300 and 1200 km s-1. It is suggested that these loops outlined closed magnetic fields guiding slow mode shocks from flares and filament eruptions.},

In this region, a small loop emerged near one of the footpoints of a pre-existing large coronal loop. These loops show evidence that interactions between coronal loops cause flares, microflares, and plasma flow. All of the four flares observed in this region show that brightenings in the small loop occurred first, and then the large loop flared up. The brightenings in the large loop can not occur by themselves, but must be triggered by the brightenings in the small loop. There must be interactions between the loops to cause these flares. As well as the flares, many microflares occurred in the small loop. More than half of them are accompanied by plasma ejection phenomena from the small loop into the large loop. The large loop is filled with ejected plasma with velocities of about 1000 km s-1. These ejection phenomena are considered as X-ray jets. The associated occurrences of the microflares and the jets suggest that they are also caused by interactions between the loops. The recurrent occurrences of the homologous flares and microflares mean that the magnetic field structure in this region inevitably causes the activity due to loop-loop interactions; the flares and jets occur under a common magnetic field structure.},

We analyze 11 months of 1 minute cadence data from Kepler, presenting Kepler flare frequency distributions, as well as determining correlations between flare energy, amplitude, duration, and decay time. We find that the exponent α of the power-law flare energy distribution varies in time, primarily due to completeness of sample and the low frequency of high-energy flares. We also find a deviation from a single power law at high energy. We use ground-based spectroscopic observations that were simultaneous with the Kepler data to provide simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic analysis of three low-energy flares, the lowest-energy dMe flares with detailed spectral analysis to date on any star. The spectroscopic data from these flares extend constraints for radiative hydrodynamic flare models to a lower energy regime than has previously been studied. We use this simultaneous spectroscopy and Kepler photometry to develop approximate conversions from the Kepler bandpass to the traditional U and B bands. This conversion will be a critical factor in comparing any Kepler flare analyses to the canon of previous ground-based flare studies.},

	abstract = {We present contemporaneous observations in the U and K bands of some 26 flares, on the active flare star G165. Over a period of 27yr, the frequency of flaring seems to have changed little. We suggest that this is due to sympathetic flaring, caused by a Moreton-wave type phenomenon, the propagation of fast magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves from the flare site out into the corona that are reflected back to the chromosphere. We have also redetermined the time-averaged U-band flare luminosity, L*\_U=3.26x10{\textasciicircum}26 erg s{\textasciicircum}-1, which is a factor of two less than previously reported, but is in closer agreement with the linear L*\_U-L\_X correlation of Doyle \& Butler. The flares fall into two main categories, with longer duration flares releasing a smaller (20 per cent) fraction of their energy over the initial rise and decay to half maximum than the shorter-lived flares ({\textgreater}=50 per cent). We also find that the evolution of some of the flares can be fitted by conduction and radiation from a hot 10{\textasciicircum}7K thermal plasma, as modelled by Mullan. We have also been able to fit Gurzadyan's model of a flare on the hidden hemisphere of the star, to two broad, low-amplitude continuum enhancements.},

Recently, Simnett (1974) and Gergely and Erickson (1975) claimed to have found such evidence, but their results were based on incorrect computations of the random incidence of flares. If the correct formula is applied, the supposed evidence disappears. The results are negative also for pairs of active regions interconnected with magnetic loops visible in soft X-rays during the Skylab mission. The only positive result (with statistical confidence of 3.4 σ) is found for pairs of active regions, which are closer than 30° to each other, without specifying any kind of physical relationship. For such pairs of regions the occurrence of short-time ({\textless} 20 min) intervals between flares is increased, but the time interval pattern does not correspond to any mode of propagation of a triggering agent in the solar atmosphere. Therefore, if the increase has real physical significance, it would be indicative of some kind of subphotospheric synchronization of activity in nearby ‘sympathetic’ active regions.},

	abstract = {We report a one-second-cadence wide-field survey for M-dwarf flares using the Tomo-e Gozen camera mounted on the Kiso Schmidt telescope. We detect 22 flares from M3-M5 dwarfs with rise times and amplitudes ranging from \$5{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{sec\} {\textbackslash}lesssim t\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rise\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 100{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{sec\}\$ and \$0.5 {\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}Delta F/F\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 20\$, respectively. The flare light curves mostly show steeper rises and shallower decays than those obtained from the Kepler one-minute cadence data and tend to have flat peak structures. Assuming a blackbody spectrum with temperatures of \$9,000-15,000{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$, the peak luminosities and bolometric energies are estimated to be \$10{\textasciicircum}\{29\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg{\textbackslash},sec{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\} {\textbackslash}lesssim L\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{peak\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{31\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg{\textbackslash},sec{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ and \$10{\textasciicircum}\{31\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg\} {\textbackslash}lesssim E\_\{{\textbackslash}rm bol\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textasciicircum}\{34\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{erg\}\$, which constitutes the bright end of fast optical flares for M dwarfs. We confirm that more than 90{\textbackslash}\% of the host stars of the detected flares are magnetically active based on their H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission line intensities obtained by LAMOST. The estimated occurrence rate of the detected flares is \${\textbackslash}sim 0.7\$ per day per an active star, indicating they are common in magnetically active M dwarfs. We argue that the flare light curves can be explained by the chromospheric compression model; the rise time is broadly consistent with the Alfvén transit time of a magnetic loop with a length scale of \$l\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{loop\} {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}\$ and a field strength of \$1,000{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{G\}\$, while the decay time is likely determined by the radiative cooling of the compressed chromosphere down to near the photosphere with a temperature of \$rsim 10,000{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{K\}\$. These flares from M dwarfs could be a major contamination source for a future search of fast optical transients of unknown types.},

Previous HST STIS coronagraphic imaging did not detect flux along the minor axis of the disk, which could suggest a face-on geometry with two clumps of dust. These ALMA observations reveal a disk with a strikingly different structure. In order to fit models to the millimeter visibilities and constrain the uncertainties on the disk parameters, we adopt a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. This is the most eccentric debris disk observed to date with a forced eccentricity of 0.21 ± 0.02, nearly twice that of the Fomalhaut debris disk, and also displays an apocenter glow. Although this eccentric model fits the outer debris disk well, significant interior residuals remain, which may suggest a possible edge-on inner disk, which remains unresolved in these observations. Combined with the observed structure difference between HST and ALMA, these results suggest a potential previous scattering event or dynamical instability in this system. We also note that the stellar flux changes considerably over the course of our observations, suggesting flaring at millimeter wavelengths. Using simultaneous TESS observations, we determine the stellar rotation period to be 9.6 ± 0.1 days.},

We discuss the correlation of line and continuum emission in the optical and ultraviolet wavelength regimes, as well as the flare energy budget, and we find that the emission properties are remarkably similar even for flares of very different evolutionary morphology. This suggests a common heating mechanism and atmospheric structure that are independent of the detailed evolution of individual flares. We also discuss the Neupert effect, chromospheric line broadening, and velocity fields observed in several transition region emission lines. The latter show significant downflows during and shortly after the flare impulsive phase. Our observations are broadly consistent with the solar model of chromospheric evaporation and condensation following impulsive heating by a flux of nonthermal electrons.

	abstract = {Stellar flares are characterized by sudden enhancement of electromagnetic radiation from the atmospheres of stars. Compared to their solar counterparts, our knowledge on the coronal plasma dynamics of stellar flares and their connection to coronal mass ejections remains very limited. With time-resolved high-resolution spectroscopic observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we detected noticeable coronal plasma flows during several stellar flares on a nearby dMe star EV Lac. In the observed spectra of O VIII (3 MK), Fe XVII (6 MK), Mg XII (10 MK), and Si XIV (16 MK) lines, these flare-induced upflows/downflows appear as significant Doppler shifts of several tens to 130 km s-1 , and the upflow velocity generally increases with temperature. Variable line ratios of the Si XIII triplet reveal that this plasma flows in most flares are accompanied by an increase in the coronal plasma density and temperature. We interpret these results as X-ray evidence of chromospheric evaporation on EV Lac. In two successive flares, the plasma flow pattern and a sharp increase of the measured coronal density are highly suggestive of explosive evaporation. The transition from redshifts to blueshifts in such an explosive evaporation occurs at a temperature of at least 10 MK, much higher than that observed in solar flares ({\textasciitilde}1 MK). However, in one flare the cool and warm upflows appear to be accompanied by a decreasing plasma density, which might be explained by a stellar filament/prominence eruption coupled to this flare. These results provide important clues to understanding the coronal plasma dynamics during flares on M dwarfs.},

The modeled light curves were subtracted from the observations to increase efficiency of flare detection. Flares were detected automatically with our new dedicated software WARPFINDER. We estimated the presence of two spots on GJ 1243 with mean temperature about 2800\${\textbackslash},\$K and spottedness varying between \$3{\textbackslash}\%-4{\textbackslash}\%\$ of the stellar surface and two spots on V374 Peg with a mean temperature of about 3000\${\textbackslash},\$K and spottedness about 6\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the stellar surface.

The second is a four-spot model with mean temperature about 2800\${\textbackslash},\$K and spottedness about 7\${\textbackslash}\%\$ of the stellar surface. We tested whether the flares are distributed homogeneously in phase and if there is any correlation between the presence of spots and the distribution of flares.

	abstract = {Extremely large telescopes (ELTs) provide an opportunity to observe surface inhomogeneities for ultracool objects including M dwarfs, brown dwarfs (BDs), and gas giant planets via Doppler imaging and spectro-photometry techniques. These inhomogeneities can be caused by star spots, clouds, and vortices. Star spots and associated stellar flares play a significant role in habitability, either stifling life or catalyzing abiogenesis depending on the emission frequency, magnitude, and orientation. Clouds and vortices may be the source of spectral and photometric variability observed at the L/T transition of BDs and are expected in gas giant exoplanets. We develop a versatile analytical framework to model and infer surface inhomogeneities which can be applied to both spectroscopic and photometric data. This model is validated against a slew of numerical simulations. Using archival spectroscopic and photometric data, we infer star spot parameters (location, size, and contrast) and generate global surface maps for Luhman 16B (an early T dwarf and one of our solar system's nearest neighbors at a distance of approximately 2 pc). We confirm previous findings that Luhman 16B's atmosphere is inhomogeneous with time-varying features. In addition, we provide tentative evidence of longer timescale atmospheric structures such as dark equatorial and bright mid-latitude to polar spots. These findings are discussed in the context of atmospheric circulation and dynamics for ultracool dwarfs. Our analytical model will be valuable in assessing the feasibility of using ELTs to study surface inhomogeneities of gas giant exoplanets and other ultracool objects.},

These stars span F5-M3 spectral types (1.2 M⊙ ≳ M ≳ 0.3 M⊙) and increase the number of known rotation periods in Blanco 1 by a factor of four. We determine rotation periods using three methods: Gaussian process (GP) regression, generalized autocorrelation function (G-ACF), and Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram, and find that the GP and G-ACF methods are more applicable to evolving spot modulation patterns. Between mid-F and mid-K spectral types, single stars follow a well-defined rotation sequence from ∼2 to 10 d, whereas stars in photometric multiple systems typically rotate faster. This may suggest that the presence of a moderate-to-high mass ratio companion inhibits angular momentum loss mechanisms during the early pre-main sequence, and this signature has not been erased at ∼100 Myr. The majority of mid-F to mid-K stars display evolving modulation patterns, whereas most M stars show stable modulation signals. This morphological change coincides with the shift from a well-defined rotation sequence (mid-F to mid-K stars) to a broad rotation period distribution (late-K and M stars). Finally, we compare our rotation results for Blanco 1 to the similarly aged Pleiades: the single-star populations in both clusters possess consistent rotation period distributions, which suggests that the angular momentum evolution of stars follows a well-defined pathway that is, at least for mid-F to mid-K stars, strongly imprinted by ∼100 Myr.},

	abstract = {Star spot evolution is visible evidence of the emergence/decay of the magnetic field on a stellar surface, and it is therefore important for the understanding of the underlying stellar dynamo and consequential stellar flares. In this paper, we report the temporal evolution of individual star spot areas on the hot-Jupiter-hosting, active solar-type star Kepler-17, whose transits occur every 1.5 days. The spot longitude and area evolution are estimated (1) from the stellar rotational modulations of Kepler data and (2) from the brightness enhancements during the exoplanet transits caused by existence of large star spots. As a result of the comparison, the number of spots, spot locations, and the temporal evolution derived from the rotational modulations are largely different from those of in-transit spots. We confirm that, although only two light-curve minima appear per rotation, there are clearly many spots present on the star. We find that the observed differential intensity changes are sometimes consistent with the spot pattern detected by transits, but at other times they do not match with each other. Although the temporal evolution derived from the rotational modulation differs from those of in-transit spots to a certain degree, the emergence/decay rates of in-transit spots are within an order of magnitude of those derived for sunspots as well as our previous research based only on rotational modulations. This supports the hypothesis that the emergence/decay of sunspots and extremely large star spots on solar-type stars occur through the same underlying processes.},

	abstract = {Active solar-type stars show large quasi-periodic brightness variations caused by stellar rotation with star spots, and the amplitude changes as the spots emerge and decay. The Kepler data are suitable for investigations of the emergence and decay processes of star spots, which are important to understand the underlying stellar dynamo and stellar flares. In this study, we measured the temporal evolution of the star-spot area with Kepler data by tracing the local minima of the light curves. In this analysis, we extracted the temporal evolution of star spots showing clear emergence and decay without being disturbed by stellar differential rotation. We applied this method to 5356 active solar-type stars observed by Kepler and obtained temporal evolution of 56 individual star spots. We calculated the lifetimes and emergence/decay rates of the star spots from the obtained temporal evolution of the spot area. As a result, we found that the lifetimes (T) of star spots range from 10 to 350 days when the spot areas (A) are 0.1\%-2.3\% of the solar hemisphere. We also compared them with sunspot lifetimes and found that the lifetimes of star spots are much shorter than those extrapolated from an empirical relation of sunspots (T ∝ A), while being consistent with other research on star-spot lifetimes. The emergence and decay rates of star spots are typically 5 × 1020 Mx hr-1 (8 MSH hr-1) with an area of 0.1\%-2.3\% of the solar hemisphere and mostly consistent with those expected from sunspots, which may indicate the same underlying processes.},

	abstract = {We have identified a star, EPIC 249706694 (HD 139139), that was observed during K2 Campaign 15 with the Kepler extended mission that appears to exhibit 28 transit-like events over the course of the 87-d observation. The unusual aspect of these dips, all but two of which have depths of 200 ± 80 ppm, is that they exhibit no periodicity, and their arrival times could just as well have been produced by a random number generator. We show that no more than four of the events can be part of a periodic sequence. We have done a number of data quality tests to ascertain that these dips are of astrophysical origin, and while we cannot be absolutely certain that this is so, they have all the hallmarks of astrophysical variability on one of two possible host stars (a likely bound pair) in the photometric aperture. We explore a number of ideas for the origin of these dips, including actual planet transits due to multiple or dust emitting planets, anomalously large TTVs, S- and P-type transits in binary systems, a collection of dust-emitting asteroids, `dipper-star' activity, and short-lived starspots. All transit scenarios that we have been able to conjure up appear to fail, while the intrinsic stellar variability hypothesis would be novel and untested.},

	abstract = {Superflares may provide the dominant source of biologically relevant UV radiation to rocky habitable-zone M-dwarf planets (M-Earths), altering planetary atmospheres and conditions for surface life. The combined line and continuum flare emission has usually been approximated by a 9000 K blackbody. If superflares are hotter, then the UV emission may be 10 times higher than predicted from the optical. However, it is unknown for how long M-dwarf superflares reach temperatures above 9000 K. Only a handful of M-dwarf superflares have been recorded with multiwavelength high-cadence observations. We double the total number of events in the literature using simultaneous Evryscope and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite observations to provide the first systematic exploration of the temperature evolution of M-dwarf superflares. We also increase the number of superflaring M dwarfs with published time-resolved blackbody evolution by ∼10×. We measure temperatures at 2 minutes cadence for 42 superflares from 27 K5-M5 dwarfs. We find superflare peak temperatures (defined as the mean of temperatures corresponding to flare FWHM) increase with flare energy and impulse. We find the amount of time flares emit at temperatures above 14,000 K depends on energy. We discover that 43\% of the flares emit above 14,000 K, 23\% emit above 20,000 K and 5\% emit above 30,000 K. The largest and hottest flare briefly reached 42,000 K. Some do not reach 14,000 K. During superflares, we estimate M-Earths orbiting {\textless}200 Myr stars typically receive a top-of-atmosphere UV-C flux of ∼120 W m-2 and up to 103 W m-2, 100-1000 times the time-averaged X-ray and UV flux from Proxima Cen.},

	abstract = {The distortions of absorption line profiles caused by photospheric brightness variations on the surfaces of cool, main-sequence stars can mimic or overwhelm radial velocity (RV) shifts due to the presence of exoplanets. The latest generation of precision RV spectrographs aims to detect velocity amplitudes ≲ 10 cm s-1, but requires mitigation of stellar signals. Statistical techniques are being developed to differentiate between Keplerian and activity-related velocity perturbations. Two important challenges, however, are the interpretability of the stellar activity component as RV models become more sophisticated, and ensuring the lowest-amplitude Keplerian signatures are not inadvertently accounted for in flexible models of stellar activity. For the K2V exoplanet host ϵ Eridani, we separately used ground-based photometry to constrain Gaussian processes for modeling RVs and TESS photometry with a light-curve inversion algorithm to reconstruct the stellar surface. From the reconstructions of TESS photometry, we produced an activity model that reduced the rms scatter in RVs obtained with EXPRES from 4.72 to 1.98 m s-1. We present a pilot study using the CHARA Array and MIRC-X beam combiner to directly image the starspots seen in the TESS photometry. With the limited phase coverage, our spot detections are marginal with current data but a future dedicated observing campaign should allow for imaging, as well as allow the stellar inclination and orientation with respect to the debris disk to be definitively determined. This work shows that stellar surface maps obtained with high-cadence, time-series photometric and interferometric data can provide the constraints needed to accurately reduce RV scatter.},

Understanding the magnetic field of the solar wind is crucial for predicting future space weather and planetary atmospheric loss. Compared to large-scale magnetic events, smaller-scale structures like magnetic discontinuities are hard to detect but entail important information on the evolution of the solar wind. A lack of labeled data makes an automated detection of these discontinuities challenging. We propose Deep-SWIM, an approach leveraging advances in contrastive learning, pseudo-labeling and online hard example mining to robustly identify discontinuities in solar wind magnetic field data. Through a systematic ablation study, we show that we can accurately classify discontinuities despite learning from only limited labeled data. Additionally, we show that our approach generalizes well and produces results that agree with expert hand-labeling.},

	abstract = {Observations of rapidly-rotating cool stars often show coronal 'slingshot' prominences that remove mass and angular momentum when they are ejected. The derived masses of these prominences show a scatter of some two orders of magnitude. In order to investigate if this scatter could be intrinsic, we use a full magnetic cycle of solar magnetograms to model the coronal structure and prominence distribution in a young Sun, where we scale the field strength in the magnetograms with angular velocity according to B ∝ Ω-1.32. We reproduce both the observed prominence masses and their scatter. We show that both the field strength and the field geometry contribute to the prominence masses that can be supported and to the rate at which they are ejected. Predicted prominence masses follow the magnetic cycle, but with half the period, peaking both at cycle maximum and at cycle minimum. We show that mass-loss rates in prominences are less than those predicted for the stellar wind. We also investigate the role of small-scale field that may be unresolved in typical stellar magnetograms. This provides only a small reduction in the predicted total prominence mass, principally by reducing the number of large magnetic loops that can support slingshot prominences. We conclude that the observed scatter in prominence masses can be explained by underlying magnetic cycles.},

In this paper, we present the result of our TESS study of the photospheric activity of the rapid rotator AB Doradus. Due to its favorable position near the southern ecliptic pole, the TESS satellite recorded almost 600 rotations of AB Doradus with high cadence, allowing us to study starspots and flares on this ultra-active star. The observed peak-to-peak variation of the rotational modulations reaches almost 11\%, and we find that the starspots on AB Doradus show highly preferred longitudinal positions. Using spot modeling, we measured the positions of the active regions on AB Doradus and we find that preferred spot configurations should include large regions extending from low to high stellar latitudes. We interpret the apparent movement of spots as the result of both differential rotation and spot evolution and argue that the typical spot lifetimes should range between 10 and 20 days. We further find a connection between the flare occurrence on AB Doradus and the visibility of the active regions on its surface, and we finally recalculated the star's rotation period using different methods and we compared it with previous determinations.},

	abstract = {Context. Ultra-short period planets undergo strong tidal interactions with their host star which lead to planet deformation and orbital tidal decay. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: WASP-103b is the exoplanet with the highest expected deformation signature in its transit light curve and one of the shortest expected spiral-in times. Measuring the tidal deformation of the planet would allow us to estimate the second degree fluid Love number and gain insight into the planet's internal structure. Moreover, measuring the tidal decay timescale would allow us to estimate the stellar tidal quality factor, which is key to constraining stellar physics. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We obtained 12 transit light curves of WASP-103b with the CHaracterising ExOplanet Satellite (CHEOPS) to estimate the tidal deformation and tidal decay of this extreme system. We modelled the high-precision CHEOPS transit light curves together with systematic instrumental noise using multi-dimensional Gaussian process regression informed by a set of instrumental parameters. To model the tidal deformation, we used a parametrisation model which allowed us to determine the second degree fluid Love number of the planet. We combined our light curves with previously observed transits of WASP-103b with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer to increase the signal-to-noise of the light curve and better distinguish the minute signal expected from the planetary deformation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We estimate the radial Love number of WASP-103b to be h{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}f{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 1.59{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}−0.53{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.45{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. This is the first time that the tidal deformation is directly detected (at 3 σ) from the transit light curve of an exoplanet. Combining the transit times derived from CHEOPS, HST, and Spitzer light curves with the other transit times available in the literature, we find no significant orbital period variation for WASP-103b. However, the data show a hint of an orbital period increase instead of a decrease, as is expected for tidal decay. This could be either due to a visual companion star if this star is bound, the Applegate effect, or a statistical artefact. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The estimated Love number of WASP-103b is similar to Jupiter's. This will allow us to constrain the internal structure and composition of WASP-103b, which could provide clues on the inflation of hot Jupiters. Future observations with James Webb Space Telescope can better constrain the radial Love number of WASP-103b due to their high signal-to-noise and the smaller signature of limb darkening in the infrared. A longer time baseline is needed to constrain the tidal decay in this system. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The transit light curves are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/657/A52"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/657/A52{\textless}/A{\textgreater}.},

	abstract = {Whilst 'slingshot' prominences have been observed on M-dwarfs, most if not all theoretical studies have focused on solar-like stars. We present an investigation into stellar prominences around rapidly rotating young M-dwarfs. We have extrapolated the magnetic field in the corona from Zeeman-Doppler maps and determined the sites of mechanical stability where prominences may form. We analyse the prominence mass that could be supported and the latitude range over which this material is distributed. We find that for these maps, much of this prominence mass may be invisible to observation - typically {\textless}1 per cent transits the stellar disc. On the rapidly rotating M-dwarf V374 Peg (Prot = 0.45 d) where prominences have been observed, we find the visible prominence mass to be around only 10 per cent of the total mass supported. The mass loss rate per unit area for prominences scales with the X-ray surface flux as \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}/A {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}, F\_{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ X\}{\textasciicircum}\{1.32\}\$ that is very close to the observationally derived value for stellar winds. This suggests that prominence ejection may contribute significantly to the overall stellar wind loss and spin-down. A planet in an equatorial orbit in the habitable zone of these stars may experience intermittent enhancements of the stellar wind due to prominence ejections. On some stars, this may occur throughout 20 per cent of the orbit.},

This modulation in phase with the planetary orbit, such as enhanced X-ray activity, chromospheric spots, radio emission, or flares, is considered the clearest sign of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI). However, the magnitude of this interaction is poorly constrained, and the intermittent nature of the interaction is a challenge for observers. AU Mic is an early M dwarf, and the most actively flaring planet host detected to date. Its innermost companion, AU Mic b, is a promising target for magnetic SPI observations. We used optical light curves of AU Mic obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite to search for signs of flaring SPI with AU Mic b using a customized Anderson-Darling test. In the about 50 d of observations, the flare distributions with orbital, rotational, and synodic periods were generally consistent with intrinsic stellar flaring. We found the strongest deviation (p = 0.07, n = 71) from intrinsic flaring with the orbital period of AU Mic b, in the high-energy half of our sample (ED {\textgreater} 1 s). If it reflects the true SPI signal from AU Mic b, extending the observing time by a factor of 2-3 will yield a {\textgreater}3σ detection. Continued monitoring of AU Mic may therefore reveal flaring SPI with orbital phase, while rotational modulation will smear out due to the star's strong differential rotation.},

	abstract = {Accretion through circumstellar disks plays an important role in star formation and in establishing the properties of the regions in which planets form and migrate. The mechanisms by which protostellar and protoplanetary disks accrete onto low-mass stars are not clear; angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is thought to be involved, but the low-ionization conditions in major regions of protoplanetary disks lead to a variety of complex nonideal magnetohydrodynamic effects whose implications are not fully understood. Accretion in pre-main-sequence stars of masses ≲1M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (and in at least some 2-3-M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} systems) is generally funneled by the stellar magnetic field, which disrupts the disk at scales typically of order a few stellar radii. Matter moving at near free-fall velocities shocks at the stellar surface; the resulting accretion luminosities from the dissipation of kinetic energy indicate that mass addition during the T Tauri phase over the typical disk lifetime ∼3 Myr is modest in terms of stellar evolution, but is comparable to total disk reservoirs as estimated from millimeter-wave dust emission (∼10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). Pre-main-sequence accretion is not steady, encompassing timescales ranging from approximately hours to a century, with longer-timescale variations tending to be the largest. Accretion during the protostellar phase—while the protostellar envelope is still falling onto the disk—is much less well understood, mostly because the properties of the central obscured protostar are difficult to estimate. Kinematic measurements of protostellar masses with new interfometric facilities should improve estimates of accretion rates during the earliest phases of star formation.},

These events trace particle acceleration, powered by magnetic reconnection, shock fronts (such as those formed by coronal mass ejections (CMEs)), and magnetospheric currents, in some cases offering the only window into these processes in stellar atmospheres. We conducted a 58 hr ultra-wideband survey for coherent radio bursts on five active M dwarfs. We used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array to observe simultaneously in three frequency bands covering a subset of 224-482 MHz and 1-6 GHz, achieving the widest fractional bandwidth to date for any observations of stellar radio bursts. We detected 22 bursts across 13 epochs, providing the first large sample of wideband dynamic spectra of stellar coherent radio bursts. The observed bursts have diverse morphology, with durations ranging from seconds to hours, but all share strong (40\%-100\%) circular polarization. No events resemble solar Type II bursts (often associated with CMEs), but we cannot rule out the occurrence of radio-quiet stellar CMEs. The hours-long bursts are all polarized in the sense of the x-mode of the star’s large-scale magnetic field, suggesting that they are cyclotron maser emission from electrons accelerated in the large-scale field, analogous to auroral processes on ultracool dwarfs. The duty cycle of luminous coherent bursts peaks at 25\% at 1-1.4 GHz, declining at lower and higher frequencies, indicating source regions in the low corona. At these frequencies, active M dwarfs should be the most common galactic transient source.},

Chirality can also enter at the microphysical level and can then be traced back to the parity-breaking weak force. Finally, chirality can arise spontaneously, but this requires not only the presence of an instability, but also the action of nonlinearity. Examples can be found both in magnetohydrodynamics and in astrobiology, where homochirality among biomolecules probably got established at the origin of life.

There is a preference for a more axisymmetric field, and possibly a more toroidal field, for the more active stars with lower Rossby number, but a larger sample should be studied to draw any strong conclusions from this.

We estimate a minimum relative amplitude ΔΩ/Ω between ∼0.08 ± 0.05 and 0.14 ± 0.05, our determination being affected by the finite lifetime of individual starspots and depending on the adopted spot model parameters.

	abstract = {We studied the weak-lined T Tauri star Hubble 4, a known long-period binary, and its star-spot phenomena. We used optical radial velocity (RV) data taken over a span of 14 yr (2004-2010, 2017-2019) at the McDonald Observatory 2.7 m Harlan J. Smith Telescope and single epoch imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 instrument. The observed and apparent RV variations show contributions, respectively, from the binary motion as well as from a large spot group on one of the stars, presumed to be the primary. Fitting and removing the orbital signal from the RVs, we found the lower bound on the lifetime of a previously identified large spot group on the surface of the star to be at least 5.1 yr. An ∼5 yr lower limit is a long, but not unprecedented, duration for a single spot group. The later epoch data indicate significant spot evolution has occurred, placing an upper bound on the spot group lifetime at 12 yr. We find that pre-main-sequence evolutionary models for the age of Taurus (∼2 Myr), combined with component mass estimates from the literature, permit us to reproduce the HST relative photometry and the binary-induced contribution to the apparent RV variations. The long-lived star spot we find on Hubble 4 has significant implications for dynamo models in young stars, as it adds evidence for long lifetimes of magnetic field topologies. There are also significant implications for young star exoplanet searches, as long-lived coherent RV signals may be spot induced and not the result of planetary motion. * This paper includes data taken at The McDonald Observatory of The University of Texas at Austin.},

We develop a method to model the stellar spectrum of a star in the presence of spots by using the out-of-transit observations. It is based on a chi squared minimization procedure of the out-of-transit spectrum on a grid of stellar spectra with different sizes and temperatures of the spots. The approach allows us also to study the temporal evolution of the spots when comparing stellar spectra observed at different epochs. We also present a method to correct the transit depth variations due to non-occulted stellar spots and estimate the error we introduce if we apply the same correction to crossings over the stellar spots. The method is tested on three types of stellar targets that ARIEL will observe in its 4-yr mission lifetime. In all the explored cases, the approach allows us to reliably recover the spot parameters (size and temperature) from out-of-transit observations and, for non-occulted spots, to confidently recover the planetary atmosphere transmission spectrum within the noise level (with average uncertainty of at most \$3.3\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ of the planetary signal).

	abstract = {Active region evolution plays an important role in the generation and variability of magnetic fields on the surface of lower main-sequence stars. However, determining the lifetime of active region growth and decay as well as their evolution is a complex task. We aim to test whether the lifetime for active region evolution shows any dependency on the stellar parameters. We identify a sample of stars with well-defined ages via their kinematics. We made use of high-resolution spectra to compute rotational velocities, activity levels, and emission excesses. We use these data to revisit the activity-rotation-age relationship. The time-series of the main optical activity indicators were analysed together with the available photometry by using Gaussian processes to model the stellar activity of these stars. Autocorrelation functions of the available photometry were also analysed. We use the derived lifetimes for active region evolution to search for correlations with the stellar age, the spectral type, and the level of activity. We also use the pooled variance technique to characterise the activity behaviour of our targets. Our analysis confirms the decline of activity and rotation as the star ages. We also confirm that the rotation rate decays with age more slowly for cooler stars and that, for a given age, cooler stars show higher levels of activity. We show that F- and G-type young stars also depart from the inactive stars in the flux-flux relationship. The gaussian process analysis of the different activity indicators does not seem to provide any useful information on active region's lifetime and evolution. On the other hand, active region's lifetimes derived from the light-curve analysis might correlate with the stellar age and temperature. Although we caution the small number statistics, our results suggest that active regions seem to live longer on younger, cooler, and more active stars.},

	abstract = {Rotational modulation of stellar light curves due to dark spots encloses information on spot properties and, thus, on magnetic activity. In particular, the decay of the autocorrelation function (ACF) of light curves is presumed to be linked to spot/active-region lifetimes, given that some coherence of the signal is expected throughout their lifetime. In the literature, an exponential decay has been adopted to describe the ACF. Here, we investigate the relation between the ACF and the active-region lifetimes. For this purpose, we produce artificial light curves of rotating spotted stars with different observation, stellar, and spot properties. We find that a linear decay and respective time-scale better represent the ACF than the exponential decay. We therefore adopt a linear decay. The spot/active-region time-scale inferred from the ACF is strongly restricted by the observation length of the light curves. For 1-yr light curves our results are consistent with no correlation between the inferred and the input time-scales. The ACF decay is also significantly affected by differential rotation and spot evolution: strong differential rotation and fast spot evolution contribute to a more severe underestimation of the active-region lifetimes. Nevertheless, in both circumstances the observed time-scale is still correlated with the input lifetimes. Therefore, our analysis suggests that the ACF decay can be used to obtain a lower limit of the active-region lifetimes for relatively long-term observations. However, strategies to avoid or flag targets with fast active-region evolution or displaying stable beating patterns associated with differential rotation should be employed.},

Our analysis of this G5V star spans eight epochs, from June 2010 to August 2015. The techniques of Doppler imaging and Zeeman-Doppler imaging were used to create brightness maps for each epoch and magnetic maps for two epochs. The brightness images show the star to have stable spot features with two main spot latitudes - a polar spot, often seen on young rapidly rotating stars such as this, and another highly unusual group of large spot features around the 20° and 30° latitudes. These lower spot latitudes appear to be rather stable over the 5 yr of observations. We included a solar-type differential rotation law into the imaging process and measured near-solid-body rotation for epochs where sufficient data exist for this analysis. The magnetic features show a dominant poloidal and a weaker toroidal magnetic field for both Stokes V epochs, which is unusual for a star with a rapid rotation period of 0.57 d. We conclude that HIP 89829 is an active young solar-type star with long-lived spots and near-solid-body rotation.},

In this work, we study three spotted DEBs, KIC 8097825, KIC 6859813 and KIC 5527172, which have been observed using Kepler photometry and Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectroscopy. The physical parameters of binaries are determined by binary modelling. The size, lifetime and single/-double-dip ratio (SDR) of starspots are derived by starspot analysis. KIC 8097825 has large starspots. KIC 6859813 has a spot rotation period shorter than its orbital period but the system should be synchronized by inference from time-scale estimation. The difference may be the result of the surface differential rotation. KIC 5527172 has a long spot lifetime and an M-dwarf component with an inflation radius. The primaries of these binaries and the secondary of KIC 8097825 have spots. Adding spotted DEBs from the literature, we compare the starspots on binaries with those on the single stars. The spot sizes of starspots on 65 per cent of binaries are smaller than the median of those on single stars. The lifetimes of starspots on binaries are consistent with those on single stars when the rotation periods are larger than 3 d. SDRs for half of the binaries are consistent with those of single-star systems, while the other half are smaller. The relative lifetime positively correlates with the rms and SDR but negatively correlates with the rotation period. These relations are similar to those of spots on single-star systems. Binaries with luminosity ratios close to the unit tend to have more double dips.},

	abstract = {From the Sun, we know that coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a transient phenomenon, often correlated with flares. They have an impact on solar mass- and angular momentum loss, and therefore solar evolution, and make a significant part of space weather. The same is true for stars, but stellar CMEs are still not well constrained, although new methodologies have been established, and new detections presented in the recent past. So far, probable detections of stellar CMEs have been presented, but their physical parameters which are not directly accessible from observations, such as electron density, optical thickness, temperature, etc., have been so far not determined for the majority of known events. We apply cloud modeling, as commonly used on the Sun, to a known event from the literature, detected on the young dMe star V374 Peg. This event manifests itself in extra emission on the blue side of the Balmer lines. By determining the line source function from 1D NLTE modeling together with the cloud model formulation, we present distributions of physical parameters of this event. We find that except for temperature and area all parameters are at the upper range of typical solar prominence parameters. The temperature and the area of the event were found to be higher than for typical solar prominences observed in Balmer lines. We find more solutions for the filament than for the prominence geometry. Moreover, we show that filaments can appear in emission on dMe stars contrary to the solar case.},

Low frequency radio observations (ν ≲ 200 MHz) of plasma and cyclotron emission from stars probe these magneto-ionic conditions. Here we report the detection of low-frequency (120-167 MHz) radio emission associated with the dMe6 star WX UMa. If the emission originates in WX UMa's corona, we show that the closed field region extends to at least ≈10 stellar radii, which is about a factor of a few larger than the solar value, and possibly to ≳20 stellar radii. Our results suggest that the magnetic-field structure of M dwarfs is in between Sun-like and planet-like configurations, where compact over-dense coronal loops with X-ray emitting plasma co-exist with a large-scale magnetosphere with a lower plasma density and closed magnetic geometry.},

	abstract = {The nearby M dwarf WX UMa has recently been detected at radio wavelengths with LOFAR. The combination of its observed brightness temperature and circular polarization fraction suggests that the emission is generated via the electron-cyclotron maser instability. Two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to power such emission from low-mass stars: either a sub-Alfvénic interaction between the stellar magnetic field and an orbiting planet, or reconnection at the edge of the stellar magnetosphere. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of both mechanisms, utilizing the information about the star's surrounding plasma environment obtained from modelling its stellar wind. Using this information, we show that a Neptune-sized exoplanet with a magnetic field strength of 10-100 G orbiting at {\textasciitilde}0.034 au can accurately reproduce the observed radio emission from the star, with a corresponding orbital period of 7.4 d. Due to the stellar inclination, a planet in an equatorial orbit is unlikely to transit the star. While such a planet could induce radial velocity semi-amplitudes from 7 to 396 m s-1, it is unlikely that this signal could be detected with current techniques due to the activity of the host star. The application of our planet-induced radio emission model here illustrates its exciting potential as a new tool for identifying planet-hosting candidates from long-term radio monitoring. We also develop a model to investigate the reconnection-powered emission scenario. While this approach produces less favourable results than the planet-induced scenario, it nevertheless serves as a potential alternative emission mechanism which is worth exploring further.},

The derived masses of these prominences show a scatter of some two orders of magnitude. In order to investigate if this scatter could be intrinsic, we use a full magnetic cycle of solar magnetograms to model the coronal structure and prominence distribution in a young Sun, where we scale the field strength in the magnetograms with angular velocity according to B ∝ Ω-1.32. We reproduce both the observed prominence masses and their scatter. We show that both the field strength and the field geometry contribute to the prominence masses that can be supported and to the rate at which they are ejected. Predicted prominence masses follow the magnetic cycle, but with half the period, peaking both at cycle maximum and at cycle minimum. We show that mass-loss rates in prominences are less than those predicted for the stellar wind. We also investigate the role of small-scale field that may be unresolved in typical stellar magnetograms. This provides only a small reduction in the predicted total prominence mass, principally by reducing the number of large magnetic loops that can support slingshot prominences. We conclude that the observed scatter in prominence masses can be explained by underlying magnetic cycles.},

	abstract = {The Gaia mission recently revealed an excess population of equal-mass "twin" wide binaries, with mass ratio \$qrsim 0.95\$, extending to separations of at least 1000 AU. The origin of this population is an enigma: twin binaries are thought to form via correlated accretion in circumbinary disks, but the largest observed protostellar disks have radii of \${\textbackslash}sim100\$ AU, far smaller than the separations of the widest twins. Here, we infer the eccentricity distribution of wide twins from the distribution of their \$v\$-\$r\$ angles, i.e., the angle between the components' separation and relative velocity vectors. We find that wide twins must be on extremely eccentric orbits. For the excess-twin population at 400-1000 AU, we infer a near-delta function excess of high-eccentricity system, with eccentricity \$0.95 {\textbackslash}lesssim e {\textbackslash}leq 1\$. These high eccentricities for wide twins imply pericenter distances of order \$10\$ AU and suggest that their orbits were scattered via dynamical interactions in their birth environments, consistent with a scenario in which twins are born in circumbinary disks and subsequently widened. These results further establish twin wide binaries as a distinct population and imply that wide twins can be used as a probe of the dynamical history of stellar populations.},

This Letter brings an enlarged and more detailed analysis that led us to the question: Is there really a dearth in that distribution or is it a dearth of data? For this new analysis, we combined different samples of Kepler and TESS stars with confirmed planets or planet candidates with measured stellar rotation periods, using Gaia data to perform an in-depth selection of 1013 planet-hosting main-sequence stars. With the newer, enlarged, and more refined data, the reported dearth of close-in planets orbiting rapid rotators tends to disappear, thus suggesting that it may reflect a scarcity of data in the prior analysis. A two sample statistical test strongly supports our results, showing that the distribution of close-in planets orbiting rapid rotators is almost indistinguishable from that for close-in planets orbiting slow rotators.},

We generate different realizations of multi-spots according to the model, and perform mock observations of the resulting lightcurve modulations. We discuss to what extent one can recover the properties of the spots and the parameters for the differential rotation law from the periodogram analysis. Although our analytical model neglects the evolution of spots on the stellar surface (dynamical motion, creation and annihilation), it provides a basic framework to interpret the photometric variation of stars, in particular from the existing Kepler data and the future space-born mission. It is also applicable to photometric modulations induced by rotation of various astronomical objects.},

Our code employs a method that uses the truncated least-squares estimation of the inverse problem's objects principal components. We use spot filling factors as the unknown objects. Various test cases that represent a rapidly-rotating K subgiant are used for the forward problem. Tests are then performed to recover the artificial input map and include data errors and input-parameter errors. We demonstrate the robustness of the solution to false input parameters like photospheric temperature, spot temperature, gravity, inclination, unspotted brightness and different spot distributions and we also demonstrate the insensitivity of the solution to spot latitude. Tests with spots peppered over the entire stellar surface or with phase gaps do not produce fake active longitudes. The code is then applied to ten years of V and I-band light curve data of the spotted sub-giant HD 291095. A total of 22 light curves is presented. We find that for most of the time its spots were grouped around two active longitudes separated on average by 180°. Switches of the dominant active region between these two longitudes likely occurred about every 3.15±0.23 years while the amplitude modulation of the brightness occurred with a possible period of 3.0±0.15 years. For the first time, we found evidence that the times of the activity flips coincide with times of minimum light as well as minimum photometric amplitude, i.e. maximum spottedness. From a comparison with simultaneous Doppler images we conclude that the activity flips likely take place near the rotational pole of the star.},

We investigate the effectiveness of using 0.4m-class telescopes for monitoring transiting hot Jupiters and their host stars. We consider two representative case studies: WASP-52b with 13 new transits, and HAT-P-23b with 17 new transits and concurrent photometric monitoring covering 78 days. We present updated system parameters and combine our new transit times with previously published results to calculate new ephemerides for both systems. Our analysis of transit mid-times for WASP52b results in a slight preference for a quadratic ephemeris (∆χ2ν = 0.07, ∆BIC = 1.53 over a linear ephemeris. We discuss the reality of this quadratic ephemeris indicating a period change of δP/δt = -38.6 ± 4 ms yr-1 and consider possible causes. WASP-52 is known to be an active star with previous publications reporting many spot crossing events, however no such events are seen in our new photometry. Our analysis shows that WASP-52 is still active and that the latitude of the spots has likely migrated away from the transit chord. We confirm the inflated nature and circular orbit for HAT-P-23b. Our monitoring of HAT-P-23 reveals a periodicity of 7.015 days with an amplitude of 0.011 mag which we interpret as the rotation period of HAT-P-23. The photometric and transit timing precision achieved in the case studies shows that this class of telescope is capable of precise characterisation and long-term monitoring of transiting hot Jupiters in support of dedicated ongoing and future ground and space based observations.},

We use these data to refine the orbital ephemeris, photometric parameters, and measured physical properties of the two systems.

The QES survey light curve of Qatar-1 has a clear sinusoidal variation on a period of P⋆ = 23.697 ± 0.123 d, implying significant star-spot activity. We searched for star-spot crossing events in our light curves, but did not find clear evidence in any of the new data sets. The planet in the Qatar-1 system did not transit the active latitudes on the surfaces of its host star. Under the assumption that P⋆ corresponds to the rotation period of Qatar-1A, the rotational velocity of this star is very close to the vsin i⋆ value found from observations of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. The low projected orbital obliquity found in this system thus implies a low absolute orbital obliquity, which is also a necessary condition for the transit chord of the planet to avoid active latitudes on the stellar surface.},

The high-latitude structure is more variable and seems to change on the order of a few rotation periods. In agreement with measurements from 1992 January, we find no indication for differential rotation on AB Doradus.},

	abstract = {Planetary transits provide a unique opportunity to investigate the surface distributions of star spots. Our aim is to determine if, with continuous observation (such as the data that will be provided by the Kepler mission), we can in addition measure the rate of drift of the spot belts. We begin by simulating magnetic cycles suitable for the Sun and more active stars, incorporating both flux emergence and surface transport. This provides the radial magnetic field distribution on the stellar surface as a function of time. We then model the transit of a planet whose orbital axis is misaligned with the stellar rotation axis. Such a planet could occult spots at a range of latitudes. This allows us to complete the forward modelling of the shape of the transit light curve. We then attempt the inverse problem of recovering spot locations from the transit alone. From this we determine if transit light curves can be used to measure spot belt locations as a function of time. We find that for low-activity stars such as the Sun, the 3.5-year Kepler window is insufficient to determine this drift rate. For more active stars, it may be difficult to distinguish subtle differences in the nature of flux emergence, such as the degree of overlap of the 'butterfly wings'. The rate and direction of drift of the spot belts can however be determined for these stars. This would provide a critical test of dynamo theory.},

	abstract = {We combine stellar surface rotation periods determined from NASA's Kepler mission with spectroscopic temperatures to demonstrate the existence of pileups at the long-period and short-period edges of the temperature-period distribution for main-sequence stars with temperatures exceeding \${\textbackslash}sim 5500\$K. The long-period pileup is well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, with a critical value of \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{Ro\_\{crit\}\} {\textbackslash}lesssim 2\$. The long-period pileup was predicted by van Saders et al. (2019) as a consequence of weakened magnetic braking, in which wind-driven angular momentum losses cease once stars reach a critical Rossby number. Stars in the long-period pileup are found to have a wide range of ages (\${\textbackslash}sim 2-6\$Gyr), meaning that, along the pileup, rotation period is strongly predictive of a star's surface temperature but weakly predictive of its age. The short-period pileup, which is also well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, is not a prediction of the weakened magnetic braking hypothesis but may instead be related to a phase of slowed surface spin-down due to core-envelope coupling. The same mechanism was proposed by Curtis et al. (2020) to explain the overlapping rotation sequences of low-mass members of differently aged open clusters. The relative dearth of stars with intermediate rotation periods between the short- and long-period pileups is also well-described by a curve of constant Rossby number, which aligns with the period gap initially discovered by McQuillan et al. (2013a) in M-type stars. These observations provide further support for the hypothesis that the period gap is due to stellar astrophysics, rather than a non-uniform star-formation history in the Kepler field.},

	abstract = {The TRAPPIST-1 planetary system provides an exceptional opportunity for the atmospheric characterization of temperate terrestrial exoplanets with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Assessing the potential impact of stellar contamination on the planets’ transit transmission spectra is an essential precursor to this characterization. Planetary transits themselves can be used to scan the stellar photosphere and to constrain its heterogeneity through transit depth variations in time and wavelength. In this context, we present our analysis of 169 transits observed in the optical from space with K2 and from the ground with the SPECULOOS and Liverpool telescopes. Combining our measured transit depths with literature results gathered in the mid-/near-IR with Spitzer/IRAC and HST/WFC3, we construct the broadband transmission spectra of the TRAPPIST-1 planets over the 0.8-4.5 μm spectral range. While planet b, d, and f spectra show some structures at the 200-300 ppm level, the four others are globally flat. Even if we cannot discard their instrumental origins, two scenarios seem to be favored by the data: a stellar photosphere dominated by a few high-latitude giant (cold) spots, or, alternatively, by a few small and hot (3500-4000 K) faculae. In both cases, the stellar contamination of the transit transmission spectra is expected to be less dramatic than predicted in recent papers. Nevertheless, based on our results, stellar contamination can still be of comparable or greater order than planetary atmospheric signals at certain wavelengths. Understanding and correcting the effects of stellar heterogeneity therefore appears essential for preparing for the exploration of TRAPPIST-1 with JWST.},

We used the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (HST WFC3) with its G141 grism covering 1.1 μm to 1.7 μm and spatially scanned the image across the detector at 2'' s-1. When smoothed to 75 nm bins, the local maxima of the transit depths in the 1.15 μm and 1.4 μm water vapor features are, respectively, 83 ± 53 ppm and 200 ± 47 ppm greater than the local minimum at 1.3 μm. We compare the WFC3 spectrum with the composite transit spectrum of HD 189733b assembled by Pont et al., extending from 0.3 μm to 24 μm. Although the water vapor features in the WFC3 spectrum are compatible with the model of non-absorbing, Rayleigh-scattering dust in the planetary atmosphere, we also re-interpret the available data with a clear planetary atmosphere. In the latter interpretation, the slope of increasing transit depth with shorter wavelengths from the near infrared, through the visible, and into the ultraviolet is caused by unocculted star spots, with a smaller contribution of Rayleigh scattering by molecular hydrogen in the planet's atmosphere. At relevant pressures along the terminator, our model planetary atmosphere's temperature is {\textasciitilde}700 K, which is below the condensation temperatures of sodium- and potassium-bearing molecules, causing the broad wings of the spectral lines of Na I and K I at 0.589 μm and 0.769 μm to be weak.},

	abstract = {GJ 1214b is the most studied sub-Neptune exoplanet to date. Recent measurements have shown its near-infrared transmission spectrum to be flat, pointing to a high-altitude opacity source in the exoplanet's atmosphere, either equilibrium condensate clouds or photochemical hazes. Many photometric observations have been reported in the optical by different groups, though simultaneous measurements spanning the entire optical regime are lacking. We present an optical transmission spectrum (4500-9260 Å) of GJ 1214b in 14 bins, measured with Magellan/IMACS repeatedly over three transits. We measure a mean planet-to-star radius ratio of \{R\}p/\{R\}s=0.1146+/- 2× \{10\}-4 and mean uncertainty of σ (\{R\}p/\{R\}s)=8.7× \{10\}-4 in the spectral bins. The optical transit depths are shallower on average than observed in the near-infrared. We present a model for jointly incorporating the effects of a composite photosphere and atmospheric transmission through the exoplanet's limb (the CPAT model), and use it to examine the cases of absorber and temperature heterogeneities in the stellar photosphere. We find the optical and near-infrared measurements are best explained by the combination of (1) photochemical haze in the exoplanetary atmosphere with a mode particle size r = 0.1 μm and haze-forming efficiency \{f\}\{haze\}=10 \% and (2) faculae in the unocculted stellar disk with a temperature contrast \{\{Δ \}\}T=\{354\}-46+46 K, assuming 3.2\% surface coverage. The CPAT model can be used to assess potential contributions of heterogeneous stellar photospheres to observations of exoplanet transmission spectra, which will be important for searches for spectral features in the optical.},

	abstract = {There have been numerous reports of anomalies during transits of the planet TrES-1b. Recently, Rabus and coworkers' analysis of Hubble Space Telescope observations lead them to claim brightening anomalies during transit might be caused by either a second transiting planet or a cool starspot. Observations of two consecutive transits are presented here from the University of Arizona's 61 inch Kuiper Telescope on 2008 May 12 and May 15 UT. A 5.4 ± 1.7 mmag (0.54\% ± 0.17\%) brightening anomaly was detected during the first half of the transit on May 12 and again in the second half of the transit on May 15. We argue that the significance of these spot events are 3.2 and 2.9 σ for May 12 and May 15, respectively, and we estimate that each of these have a probability {\textgreater}=90\% of not being systematic red-noise peaks. Therefore, we conclude that this is a tentative detection of a r {\textgreater}=6R ⊕ starspot rotating on the surface of the star. We suggest that all evidence to date suggest TrES-1 has a spotty surface, and there is no need to introduce a second transiting planet in this system to explain these anomalies. Assuming that the spin axis of the star and orbital axis of the planet are aligned (and in the plane of the sky) suggests a stellar rotational period of 40.2 ± 0.1 days. Introducing the λ = 30° ± 21° inclination of the stellar spin axis with respect to the planetary orbital axis of Narita et al. adds much more uncertainty, and we are only able to constrain the rotational period of the star to 40.2+22.9 -14.6 days, which is consistent with the previously observed P obs = 33.2+22.3 -14.3 day period. We note that this technique could be applied to other transiting systems for which starspots exist on the star in the transit path of the planet in order to constrain the rotation rate of the star.},

The 0.38-d axial rotation period and the V-band magnitude of 9.33 make it a difficult target for Doppler imaging. In order to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio profiles from 300-s exposures, we apply the technique of least-squares deconvolution to the large number of photospheric absorption lines available in each of our spectra. This allows us to derive high-resolution maximum-entropy-regularized Doppler images of the stellar surface. Using these techniques, we also derive radial velocities and accurate projected equatorial rotation velocities which are consistent to within {\textasciitilde}1kms-1. Our surface maps reveal one of the most heavily spotted photospheres seen on a rapid rotator, with starspots occurring at all latitudes. At the time of observations, Speedy Mic had no strong polar spot, but it shows spots concentrated in low- and intermediate-latitude bands. We attempt a differential rotation measurement, but lack of sufficient phase coverage allows determination of only a lower limit of 59d for the time it takes the equatorial regions to lap the polar regions. We also find variations in the heavily filled-in Hα line which can be attributed to prominences passing in front of the stellar disc. Despite the rapid rotation, the appearance of the same features on consecutive nights of observations shows the clouds to be stable on time-scales of at least a day.},

The focus on this object has produced a number of high-cadence transit observations using high-resolution optical spectrographs. Here we present an analysis of seven full Hα transits of HD 189733 b using HARPS on the 3.6 meter La Silla telescope and HIRES on Keck I, taken over the course of nine years from 2006 to 2015. Hα transmission signals are analyzed as a function of the stellar activity level, as measured using the normalized core flux of the Ca II H and K lines. We find strong variations in the strength of the Hα transmission spectrum from epoch to epoch. However, there is no clear trend between the Ca II core emission and the strength of the in-transit Hα signal, although the transit showing the largest absorption value also occurs when the star is the most active. We present simulations of the in-transit contrast effect and find that the planet must consistently transit active latitudes with very strong facular and plage emission regions in order to reproduce the observed line strengths. We also investigate the measured velocity centroids with models of planetary rotation and show that the small line profile velocities could be due to large velocities in the upper atmosphere of the planet. Overall, we find it more likely that the measured Hα signals arise in the extended planetary atmosphere, although a better understanding of active region emission for active stars such as HD 189733 is needed.},

	abstract = {Transmission spectra are differential measurements that utilize stellar illumination to probe transiting exoplanet atmospheres. Any spectral difference between the illuminating light source and the disk-integrated stellar spectrum due to starspots and faculae will be imprinted in the observed transmission spectrum. However, few constraints exist for the extent of photospheric heterogeneities in M dwarfs. Here we model spot and faculae covering fractions consistent with observed photometric variabilities for M dwarfs and the associated 0.3-5.5 μm stellar contamination spectra. We find that large ranges of spot and faculae covering fractions are consistent with observations and corrections assuming a linear relation between variability amplitude, and covering fractions generally underestimate the stellar contamination. Using realistic estimates for spot and faculae covering fractions, we find that stellar contamination can be more than 10× larger than the transit depth changes expected for atmospheric features in rocky exoplanets. We also find that stellar spectral contamination can lead to systematic errors in radius and therefore the derived density of small planets. In the case of the TRAPPIST-1 system, we show that TRAPPIST-1's rotational variability is consistent with spot covering fractions \{f\}\{spot\}=\{8\}-7+18 \% and faculae covering fractions \{f\}\{fac\}=\{54\}-46+16 \% . The associated stellar contamination signals alter the transit depths of the TRAPPIST-1 planets at wavelengths of interest for planetary atmospheric species by roughly 1-15× the strength of planetary features, significantly complicating JWST follow-up observations of this system. Similarly, we find that stellar contamination can lead to underestimates of the bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets of \{\{Δ \}\}(ρ )=-\{8\}-20+7 \% , thus leading to overestimates of their volatile contents.},

	abstract = {Chromospherically sensitive atomic lines display different spectra in stellar active regions, spots, and the photosphere, raising the possibility that exoplanet transmission spectra are contaminated by the contrast between various portions of the stellar disk. To explore this effect, we performed transit simulations of G-type and K-type stars for the spectral lines Ca II K at 3933 Å, Na I 5890 Å, H I 6563 Å (Hα), and He I 10830 Å. We find that strong facular emission and large coverage fractions can contribute a non-negligible amount to transmission spectra, especially for Hα, Ca II K, and Na I D, while spots and filaments are comparatively unimportant. The amount of contamination depends strongly on the location of the active regions and the intrinsic emission strength. In particular, active regions must be concentrated along the transit chord in order to produce a consistent in-transit signal. Mean absorption signatures in Na I and Hα, for example, can reach ≈0.2\% and 0.3\%, respectively, for transits of active latitudes with line emission similar in strength to moderate solar flares. Transmission spectra of planets transiting active stars, such as HD 189733, are likely contaminated by the contrast effect, although the tight constraints on active region geometry and emission strength make it unlikely that consistent in-transit signatures are due entirely to the contrast effect. He I 10830 Å is not strongly affected and absorption signatures are likely diluted, rather than enhanced, by stellar activity. He I 10830 Å should thus be considered a priority for probing extended atmospheres, even in the case of active stars.},

	abstract = {Stellar variability is a limiting factor for planet detection and characterization, particularly around active M-type stars. Here we revisit one of the most active stars from the Kepler mission, the M4 star GJ 1243, and use a sample of 414 flare events from 11 months of 1-minute cadence light curves to study the empirical morphology of white-light stellar flares. We use a Gaussian process detrending technique to account for the underlying starspots. We present an improved analytic, continuous flare template that is generated by stacking the flares onto a scaled time and amplitude and uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to fit the model. Our model is defined using classical flare events, but can also be used to model complex, multi-peaked flare events. We demonstrate the utility of our model using TESS data at the 10-minute, 2-minute and 20-second cadence modes. Our new flare model code is made publicly available on GitHub.},

Praesepe and the Hyades, two of the nearest, most-studied open clusters, are among the best available laboratories for examining the dependence of magnetic activity on rotation for stars with masses ≲1 M ⊙. We present an updated study of the rotation-X-ray activity relation in the two clusters. We updated membership catalogs that combine pre-Gaia catalogs with new catalogs based on Gaia Data Release 2. The resulting catalogs are the most inclusive ones for both clusters: 1739 Praesepe and 1315 Hyades stars. We collected X-ray detections for cluster members, for which we analyzed, re-analyzed, or collated data from ROSAT, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and XMM-Newton. We have detections for 326 Praesepe and 462 Hyades members, of which 273 and 164, respectively, have rotation periods-an increase of 6× relative to what was previously available. We find that at ≍700 Myr, only M dwarfs remain saturated in X-rays, with only tentative evidence for supersaturation. We also find a tight relation between the Rossby number and fractional X-ray luminosity L X/L bol in unsaturated single members, suggesting a power-law index between -3.2 and -3.9. Lastly, we find no difference in the coronal parameters between binary and single members. These results provide essential insight into the relative efficiency of magnetic heating of the stars' atmospheres, thereby informing the development of robust age-rotation-activity relations.},

Based on the latest astrophysical information, we carry out Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the number of possible CETIs within our Galaxy and the communication probability among them. Two poorly known parameters have a great impact on the results. One is the probability of life appearing on terrestrial planets and eventually evolving a into CETI (\$f\_c\$), and the other determines at what stage of their host star's evolution CETIs would be born (\$F\$). In order to ensure the completeness of the simulation, we consider a variety of combinations of \$f\_c\$ and \$F\$. Our results indicate that for optimistic situations (e.g. \$F=25{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$f\_c=0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$), there could be \$42777\_\{-369\}{\textasciicircum}\{+267\}\$ CETIs and they need to survive for \$3\_\{-2\}{\textasciicircum}\{+17\}\$ yr (\$2000\_\{-1400\}{\textasciicircum}\{+2000\}\$ yr) to achieve one-way communication (two-way communication).

For pessimistic situations (e.g. \$F=75{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$f\_c=0.001{\textbackslash}\%\$), only \$111\_\{-17\}{\textasciicircum}\{+28\}\$ CETIs could be born and they need to survive for \$0.8\_\{-0.796\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.2\}\$ Myr (\$0.9\_\{-0.88\}{\textasciicircum}\{+4.1\}\$ Myr) to achieve one-way communication (two-way communication).

Here we show that Sun-as-a-star spectroscopic observations, together with imaging observations, could allow us to solve this problem. Using observations of the Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we found clear blueshifted secondary emission components in extreme-ultraviolet spectral lines during a solar eruption on 2021 October 28. From simultaneous imaging observations, we found that the secondary components are caused by a mass ejection from the flare site. We estimated the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of the ejecta from both the double Gaussian fitting method and the red-blue asymmetry analysis. The results of both methods agree well with each other, giving an average LOS velocity of the plasma of {\textasciitilde}423 km s-1. From the 304 Å image series taken by the Extreme ultraviolet Imager onboard the Solar Terrestrial Relation Observatory-A (STEREO-A) spacecraft, we estimated the plane-of-sky velocity from the STEREO-A viewpoint to be around 587 km s-1. The full velocity of the bulk motion of the ejecta was then computed by combining the imaging and spectroscopic observations, which turns out to be around 596 km s-1 with an angle of 42.°4 to the west of the Sun-Earth line and 16.°0 south to the ecliptic plane.},

We have estimated the UBV magnitudes from spectrograms through a mathematical convolution of the spectra with the filter transmission curves. The flare amplitudes in the UBV band up to 0.8 magnitudes were discovered. A detailed colorimetric analysis has allowed important parameters of the flares on AR Lac to be estimated: the temperatures at maximum light and their sizes. The color-color \$(U-B)\$ - \$(B-V)\$ diagrams confirm that all the flares at maximum light radiate as a blackbody. The temperatures at maximum light were up to 12000 \${\textbackslash}pm \$ 300 K. Based on our colorimetric analysis, we have estimated the linear sizes of the flares at maximum light. The linear size of the flares at the maximum luminosity is approximately 2{\textbackslash}\% of the radius of the star.},

	abstract = {M-dwarfs are thought to be hostile environments for exoplanets. Stellar events are very common on such stars. These events might cause the atmospheres of exoplanets to change significantly over time. It is not only the major stellar flare events that contribute to this disequilibrium, but the smaller flares might also affect the atmospheres in an accumulating manner. In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of time-dependent stellar activity on the atmospheres of known exoplanets. We simulate the chemistry of GJ876c, GJ581c, and GJ832c that go from H\$\_2\$-dominated to N\$\_2\$-dominated atmospheres using observed stellar spectra from the MUSCLES-collaboration. We make use of the chemical kinetics code VULCAN and implement a flaring routine that stochastically generates synthetic flares based on observed flare statistics. Using the radiative transfer code petitRADTrans we also simulate the evolution of emission and transmission spectra. We investigate the effect of recurring flares for a total of 11 days covering 515 flares. Results show a significant change in abundance for some relevant species such as H, OH, and CH\$\_4\$, with factors going up to 3 orders of magnitude difference with respect to the preflare abundances. We find a maximum change of \${\textbackslash}sim\$12 ppm for CH\$\_4\$ in transmission spectra on GJ876c. These changes in the spectra remain too small to observe. We also find that the change in abundance and spectra of the planets accumulate throughout time, causing permanent changes in the chemistry. We conclude this small but gradual change in chemistry arises due to the recurring flares.},

	abstract = {The heating mechanism at high densities during M-dwarf flares is poorly understood. Spectra of M-dwarf flares in the optical and near-ultraviolet wavelength regimes have revealed three continuum components during the impulsive phase: 1) an energetically dominant blackbody component with a color temperature of T≈104 K in the blue-optical, 2) a smaller amount of Balmer continuum emission in the near-ultraviolet at λ≤3 646 Å, and 3) an apparent pseudo-continuum of blended high-order Balmer lines between λ=3 646 Å and λ≈3 900 Å. These properties are not reproduced by models that employ a typical "solar-type" flare heating level of ≤ 10{\textasciicircum}\{11\} erg cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} in nonthermal electrons, and therefore our understanding of these spectra is limited to a phenomenological three-component interpretation. We present a new 1D radiative-hydrodynamic model of an M-dwarf flare from precipitating nonthermal electrons with a high energy flux of 10{\textasciicircum}\{13\} erg cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}. The simulation produces bright near-ultraviolet and optical continuum emission from a dense (n{\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}\{15\} cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}), hot (T ≈12 000 - 13 500 K) chromospheric condensation. For the first time, the observed color temperature and Balmer jump ratio are produced self-consistently in a radiative-hydrodynamic flare model. We find that a T≈104 K blackbody-like continuum component and a low Balmer jump ratio result from optically thick Balmer (∞→ n=2) and Paschen recombination (∞→ n=3) radiation, and thus the properties of the flux spectrum are caused by blue (λ≈4 300 Å) light escaping over a larger physical depth range than by red (λ≈6 700 Å) and near-ultraviolet (λ≈3 500 Å) light. To model the near-ultraviolet pseudo-continuum previously attributed to overlapping Balmer lines, we include the extra Balmer continuum opacity from Landau-Zener transitions that result from merged, high-order energy levels of hydrogen in a dense, partially ionized atmosphere. This reveals a new diagnostic of ambient charge density in the densest regions of the atmosphere that are heated during dMe and solar flares.},

	abstract = {We examine empirical atmospheric structures that are consistent with enhanced white-light continuum emission in solar flares. This continuum can be produced either by hydrogen bound-free emission in an enhanced region in the upper chromosphere, or by H- emission in an enhanced region around the temperature minimum. In the former case, weak Paschen jumps in the spectrum will be present, with the spectrum being dominated by a strong Balmer continuum, while in the latter case the spectrum exhibits a weaker, flat enhancement over the entire visible spectrum. We find that when proper account is taken of radiative backwarming processes, the two enhanced atmospheric regions above are not independent, in that irradiation by Balmer continuum photons from the upper chromosphere creates sufficient heating around the temperature minimum to account for the temperature enhancements there. Thus the problem of main phase white-light flare production reduces to one of creating temperature enhancements of order 104 K in the upper chromosphere; radiative backwarming then naturally accounts for the enhancements of order 100 K around the temperature minimum. Heating by electron and proton bombardment, and by XUV irradiation from above, are then considered as candidates for creating the necessary enhancements in the upper chromosphere. We find that electron bombardment can be ruled out, whereas bombardment by protons in the few-MeV energy range is a viable candidate, but one without strong observational support. The XUV irradiation hypothesis is examined by incorporating it self-consistently into the PANDORA radiative transfer algorithm used to construct the empirical model atmospheres; we find that the introduction of XUV radiation, with flux and spectrum appropriate to white-light flare events, does indeed produce sufficient radiative heating in the upper chromosphere to balance the radiative losses associated with the required temperature enhancements. In summary, we find that the radiative coupling of (i) the upper chromosphere and temperature minimum regions (through Balmer continuum photons) and (ii) the transition region and upper chromosphere (through XUV photons) can account for white-light emission in solar flares.},

The advanced capabilities of EIS were used to measure Doppler shifts in 15 emission lines covering the temperature range T = 0.05-16 MK during the impulsive phase of a C-class flare on 2007 December 14. Blueshifts indicative of the evaporated material were observed in six emission lines from Fe XIV-XXIV (2-16 MK). Upflow velocity (v up) was found to scale with temperature as v up (km s-1) ≈ 8-18T(MK). Although the hottest emission lines, Fe XXIII and Fe XXIV, exhibited upflows of {\textgreater}200 km s-1, their line profiles were found to be dominated by a stationary component in contrast to the predictions of the standard flare model. Emission from O VI-Fe XIII lines (0.5-1.5 MK) was found to be redshifted by v down (km s-1) ≈ 60-17T (MK) and was interpreted as the downward-moving "plug" characteristic of explosive evaporation. These downflows occur at temperatures significantly higher than previously expected. Both upflows and downflows were spatially and temporally correlated with HXR emission observed by RHESSI that provided the properties of the electron beam deemed to be the driver of the evaporation. The energy flux of the electron beam was found to be gsim5 × 1010 erg cm-2 s-1, consistent with the value required to drive explosive chromospheric evaporation from hydrodynamic simulations.},

We have used hard X-ray data from the Hard X-Ray Burst Spectrometer (HXRBS) on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) and soft X-ray data from the detector on GOES to determine what fraction of all events show this correlation and how the correlation changes from the impulsive to the gradual phase. We have found that of 66 HXRBS events observed in 1980 with a peak rate of {\textgreater} 1000 counts s-1, 58 (80\%) showed good correlations with peaks in the GOES time derivative plot corresponding to peaks in the hard X-ray (HXR) plots to within ±20 s. In 20 of these good-correlation cases (30\%), the soft X-ray (SXR) time derivative stays high after the HXR emission has decreased suggesting that the later emissions result from energy release in a loop already affected by the initial energy release. In 8 of the 13 flares that showed poor correlation, the SXR time derivative shows no peak corresponding to the initial HXR impulsive peak that has structure on a time scale of ≤ 1 s. This suggests that in these events the initial impulsive energy release results primarily in electron acceleration, and that the secondary plasma heating from the accelerated electrons contributes relatively little compared to the more gradual plasma heating already taking place at the same time. The more gradually varying events, commonly referred to as type C flares, tend to show poorer correlation between the SXR time derivative and the HXR time profile. Of 26 GOES X1 or greater flares recorded between 1980 and 1989 with HXR peaks lasting over 10 rain, 13 (50\%) showed poor correlation with the gradual HXR peaks either not registering at all in the SXR time derivative plots or showing up as very broad peaks. In one case, on 1981 April 26, the SXR time derivative peak was delayed by 13 rain. Only 17 (65\%) of the 26 X-flares had an earlier, impulsive component and of those, 12 (71\%) showed good correlation between the impulsive peaks.},

The constancy of line emission from Fe ix through Fe xv, coupled with strong enhancements in higher ionization stages, suggests that additional material, not originally at coronal temperature, is rapidly heated and elevated to high stages of ionization during the event. Such heating and ionization may be the result of collisional losses by energetic electrons which are also responsible for the impulsive microwave burst},

Red-shifted emission streaks of Hα line are found at the initial phase of almost all flares which occur near the disk center, and are considered to be substantial features of the red asymmetry. It is found that a downward motion in the flare chromospheric region is the cause of the red-shifted emission streak. The downward motion abruptly increases at the onset of a flare, attains its maximum velocity of about 40 to 100 km s-1 shortly before the impulsive peak of the microwave burst, and rapidly decreases before the intensity of Hα line reaches its maximum. Referring to the numerical simulations made by Livshits et al. (1981) and Somov et al. (1982), we conclude that the conspicuous red-asymmetry or the red-shifted emission streak of Hα line is due to the downward motion of the compressed chromospheric flare region produced by the impulsive heating by energetic electron beam or thermal conduction.},

	abstract = {Context. Flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are important for the evolution of the atmospheres of planets and their potential habitability, particularly for planets orbiting M stars at a distance \&lt;0.4 AU. Detections of CMEs on these stars have been sparse, and previous studies have therefore modelled their occurrence frequency by scaling up solar relations. However, because the topology and strength of the magnetic fields on M stars is different from that of the Sun, it is not obvious that this approach works well. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We used a large number of high-resolution spectra to study flares, CMEs, and their dynamics of the active M dwarf star AD Leo. The results can then be used as reference for other M dwarfs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We obtained more than 2000 high-resolution spectra (R {\textasciitilde} 35 000) of the highly active M dwarf AD Leo, which is viewed nearly pole on. Using these data, we studied the behaviour of the spectral lines H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}β{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and He I 5876 in detail and investigated asymmetric features that might be Doppler signatures of CMEs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We detected numerous flares. The largest flare emitted 8.32 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}31{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg in H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}β{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and 2.12 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}32{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg in H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Although the spectral lines in this and other events showed a significant blue asymmetry, the velocities associated with it are far below the escape velocity. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Although AD Leo shows a high level of flare activity, the number of CMEs is relatively low. It is thus not appropriate to use the same flare-to-CME relation for M dwarfs as for the Sun. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The reduced spectra are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/637/A13"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/637/A13{\textless}/A{\textgreater} {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations obtained at the Thüringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg, Germany.},

Such a two-dimensional spectroscopic observation covering the entire evolution of a flare ribbon with high spatial (0.''1 pixel-1 image scale), cadence (4.8 s), and spectral (0.1 Å step size) resolution is rarely reported. The flare consists of a main circular ribbon that occurred in a parasitic magnetic configuration and a remote ribbon that was observed by the IBIS. Such a circular-ribbon flare with a remote brightening is predicted in three-dimensional fan-spine reconnection but so far has been rarely studied. During the flare impulsive phase, we define "core" and "halo" structures in the observed ribbon based on IBIS narrowband images in the Hα line wing and line center. Examining the Hα emission spectra averaged in the flare core and halo areas, we find that only those from the flare cores show typical nonthermal electron beam heating characteristics that have been revealed by previous theoretical simulations and observations of flaring Hα line profiles. These characteristics include broad and centrally reversed emission spectra, excess emission in the red wing with regard to the blue wing (i.e., red asymmetry), and redshifted bisectors of the emission spectra. We also observe rather quick timescales for the heating ({\textasciitilde}30 s) and cooling ({\textasciitilde}14-33 s) in the flare core locations. Therefore, we suggest that the flare cores revealed by IBIS track the sites of electron beam precipitation with exceptional spatial and temporal resolution. The flare cores show two-stage motion (a parallel motion along the ribbon followed by an expansion motion perpendicular to the ribbon) during the two impulsive phases of the flare. Some cores jump quickly (30 km s-1) between discrete magnetic elements implying reconnection involving different flux tubes. We observe a very high temporal correlation (gsim 0.9) between the integrated Hα and hard X-rays (HXR) emission during the flare impulsive phase. A short time delay (4.6 s) is also found in the Hα emission spikes relative to HXR bursts. The ionization timescale of the cool chromosphere and the extra time taken for the electrons to travel to the remote ribbon site may contribute to this delay.},

We analyze the continuum and emission line data from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) of the brightest flaring magnetic footpoints in this flare. We compare the NUV spectra of the brightest pixels to new radiative-hydrodynamic predictions calculated with the RADYN code using constraints on a nonthermal electron beam inferred from the collisional thick-target modeling of hard X-ray data from Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager. We show that the atmospheric response to a high beam flux density satisfactorily achieves the observed continuum brightness in the NUV. The NUV continuum emission in this flare is consistent with hydrogen (Balmer) recombination radiation that originates from low optical depth in a dense chromospheric condensation and from the stationary beam-heated layers just below the condensation. A model producing two flaring regions (a condensation and stationary layers) in the lower atmosphere is also consistent with the asymmetric Fe II chromospheric emission line profiles observed in the impulsive phase.},

In the most active M dwarfs, Hα is found in emission, sometimes with a complex line profile. Previous studies have reported extended wings and asymmetries in the Hα line during flares. We used a total of 473 high-resolution spectra of 28 active M dwarfs obtained by the CARMENES (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exo-Earths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs) spectrograph to study the occurrence of broadened and asymmetric Hα line profiles and their association with flares, and examine possible physical explanations. We detected a total of 41 flares and 67 broad, potentially asymmetric, wings in Hα. The broadened Hα lines display a variety of profiles with symmetric cases and both red and blue asymmetries. Although some of these line profiles are found during flares, the majority are at least not obviously associated with flaring. We propose a mechanism similar to coronal rain or chromospheric downward condensations as a cause for the observed red asymmetries; the symmetric cases may also be caused by Stark broadening. We suggest that blue asymmetries are associated with rising material, and our results are consistent with a prevalence of blue asymmetries during the flare onset. Besides the Hα asymmetries, we find some cases of additional line asymmetries in He I D{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, Na I D lines, and the He I line at 10 830 Å taken all simultaneously thanks to the large wavelength coverage of CARMENES. Our study shows that asymmetric Hα lines are a rather common phenomenon in M dwarfs and need to be studied in more detail to obtain a better understanding of the atmospheric dynamics in these objects.},

We investigated the temporal evolution and the spatial distribution of the red asymmetry by using Hα data taken with the 60-cm Domeless Solar Telescope at Hida Observatory, Kyoto University. We confirmed that the red asymmetry clearly appeared all over the flare ribbons, and the strong red asymmetry is located on the outer narrow edges of the flare ribbons, with a width of about 1.5"-3.0" (1000-2000 km), where strong energy releases occur. Moreover, we found that the red asymmetry, which also gives a measure of the Doppler shift of the Hα emission line, concentrates on a certain value, not depending on the intensity of the Hα kernels. This implies not only that the temporal evolutions of the red asymmetry and those of the intensity are not synchronous in each flare kernel, but also that the peak asymmetry (or velocity of the chromospheric condensation) of individual kernel is not a strong function of their peak intensity.},

In the case of gentle evaporation, velocities in the upper chromosphere are upward. In the case of explosive evaporation, the overpressure of the evaporated material drives downward motion in the residual flare chromosphere. The plasma driven downward by explosive evaporation is cool and dense in comparison with the chromospheric material ahead of it. We review previous discussions of these "chromospheric condensations" and conclude that physical understanding has been incomplete. We suggest that these condensations are an inevitable consequence of compression of a thermally stable heated plasma. We then investigate the nature of hydrodynamic waves in a heated, strongly radiating, optically thin plasma. It is first shown that acoustic waves in the flare chromosphere travel more slowly than adiabatic or even isothermal sound waves. Next, a simple model for the formation and propagation of chromospheric condensations is developed. This model is based on the propagation of a compression wave into the chromosphere, with quasi-steady equilibrium between flare heating and radiative losses on each side of the compression front. We derive jump conditions and accretion rates for the compression wave. We find that this simple model agrees well with our numerical simulations.},

We report results from our spectroscopic survey of M dwarfs in the Southern Continuous Viewing Zone (CVZ) of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). As the TESS CVZs overlap with those of the James Webb Space Telescope, our targets constitute a legacy sample for studies of nearby M dwarfs. For 122 stars, we obtained at least one \$R{\textbackslash}approx 2000\$ optical spectrum with which we measure chromospheric \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}{\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission, a proxy for magnetic field strength. The fraction of active stars is consistent with what is expected for field M dwarfs; as in previous studies, we find that late-type M dwarfs remain active for longer than their early type counterparts. While the TESS light curves for \${\textbackslash}approx\$20\% of our targets show modulations consistent with rotation, TESS systematics are not well enough understood for confident measurements of rotation periods (\$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rot\}\}\$) longer than half the length of an observing sector. We report periods for 12 stars for which we measure \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rot\}\} \{{\textbackslash}lower0.8ex{\textbackslash}hbox\{\${\textbackslash}buildrel {\textless}{\textbackslash}over{\textbackslash}sim\$\}\}\$ 15 d or find confirmation for the TESS-derived \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rot\}\}\$ in the literature. Our sample of 21 \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rot\}\}\$, which includes periods from the literature, is consistent with our targets being spun-down field stars. Finally, we examine the \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}{\textbackslash}alpha\$-to-bolometric luminosity distribution for our sample. Two stars are rotating fast enough to be magnetically saturated, but are not, hinting at the possibility that fast rotators may appear inactive in \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{H\}{\textbackslash}alpha\$.},

	abstract = {We investigate the flare-frequency distributions of 5 M-dwarfs that experienced superflares with energies in excess of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{33\}\$ erg detected by ASAS-SN. We use K2 and TESS short-cadence observations along with archival ASAS-SN data to categorise the flaring behaviour of these stars across a range of flare energies. We were able to extract a rotation period for 4 of the stars. They were all fast rotators (\$P\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rot\}\} {\textbackslash}leq 6 {\textbackslash}textrm\{d\}\$), implying relative youth. We find that the flare-frequency distributions for each of the stars are well fit by a power-law, with slopes between \${\textbackslash}alpha = 1.22\$ and \${\textbackslash}alpha= 1.82\$. These slopes are significantly flatter than those of fast-rotating M-dwarfs not selected for their superflaring activity, corresponding to an increased number of high energy flares. Despite our specific selection of superflaring stars with shallow flare-rate distributions and more power in higher-energy flares, we find that the implied UV flux is insufficient to deplete the ozone of earth-sized planets in the habitable zone around these stars. Furthermore, we find that the flares detected on the stars in our sample are insufficient to produce the UV flux needed to fuel abiogenetic processes. These results imply that given available models, even M-dwarfs selected for extreme flaring properties may have insufficient UV emission from flares to impact exolife on earth-sized planets in the habitable zones around M-dwarfs.},

In this Cool Stars XVI Splinter Session, we aimed to use the M4 transition as an opportunity for discussion about the interiors of low-mass stars and the mechanisms which determine their fundamental properties. By the conclusion of the session, several key points were elucidated. Although M dwarfs exhibit significant changes across the fully convective boundary, this "M4 transition" is not observationally sharp or discrete. Instead, the properties of M dwarfs (radius, effective temperature, rotation, activity lifetime, magnetic field strength and topology) show smooth changes across M3-M6 spectral types. In addition, a wide range of stellar masses share similar spectral types around the fully convective transition. There appears to be a second transition at M6-M8 spectral types, below which there exists a clear dichotomy of magnetic field topologies. Finally, we used the information and ideas presented in the session to construct a framework for how the structure of an M dwarf star, born with specific mass and chemical composition, responds to the presence of its magnetic field, itself driven by a feedback process that links the star's rotation, interior structure, and field topology.},

	abstract = {Planets interact with their host stars through gravity, radiation, and magnetic fields, and for those giant planets that orbit their stars within ∼10 stellar radii (∼0.1 AU for a sun-like star), star-planet interactions (SPI) are observable with a wide variety of photometric, spectroscopic, and spectropolarimetric studies. At such close distances, the planet orbits within the sub-Alfvénic radius of the star in which the transfer of energy and angular momentum between the two bodies is particularly efficient. The magnetic interactions appear as enhanced stellar activity modulated by the planet as it orbits the star rather than only by stellar rotation. These SPI effects are informative for the study of the internal dynamics and atmospheric evolution of exoplanets. The nature of magnetic SPI is modeled to be strongly affected by both the stellar and planetary magnetic fields, possibly influencing the magnetic activity of both, as well as affecting the irradiation and even the migration of the planet and rotational evolution of the star. As phase-resolved observational techniques are applied to a large statistical sample of hot Jupiter systems, extensions to other tightly orbiting stellar systems, such as smaller planets close to M dwarfs become possible. In these systems, star-planet separations of tens of stellar radii begin to coincide with the radiative habitable zone where planetary magnetic fields are likely a necessary condition for surface habitability.},

	abstract = {Stellar dynamos generate magnetic fields that are of fundamental importance to the variability and evolution of Sun-like and low-mass stars, and for the development of their planetary systems. We report measurements of surface-average magnetic fields in 292 M dwarfs from a comparison with radiative transfer calculations; for 260 of them, this is the first measurement of this kind. Our data were obtained from more than 15,000 high-resolution spectra taken during the CARMENES project. They reveal a relation between average field strength, , and Rossby number, \$Ro\$, resembling the well-studied rotation-activity relation. Among the slowly rotating stars, we find that magnetic flux, \${\textbackslash}Phi\_{\textbackslash}textrm\{B\}\$, is proportional to rotation period, \$P\$, and among the rapidly rotating stars that average surface fields do not grow significantly beyond the level set by the available kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find close relations between nonthermal coronal X-ray emission, chromospheric H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and Ca H\&K emission, and magnetic flux. Taken together, these relations demonstrate empirically that the rotation-activity relation can be traced back to a dependence of the magnetic dynamo on rotation. We advocate the picture that the magnetic dynamo generates magnetic flux on the stellar surface proportional to rotation rate with a saturation limit set by the available kinetic energy, and we provide relations for average field strengths and nonthermal emission that are independent of the choice of the convective turnover time. We also find that Ca H\&K emission saturates at average field strengths of \${\textbackslash}langle B {\textbackslash}rangle {\textbackslash}approx 800\$ G while H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and X-ray emission grow further with stronger fields in the more rapidly rotating stars. This is in conflict with the coronal stripping scenario predicting that in the most rapidly rotating stars coronal plasma would be cooled to chromospheric temperatures.},

	abstract = {We present the complete Bayesian statistical analysis of the HArps-n red Dwarf Exoplanet Survey (HADES), which monitored the radial velocities of a large sample of M dwarfs with HARPS-N at TNG, over the last 6 years. The targets were selected in a narrow range of spectral types from M0 to M3, \$0.3\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot {\textless} M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textless} 0.71\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, in order to study the planetary population around a well-defined class of host stars. We take advantage of Bayesian statistics to derive an accurate estimate of the detectability function of the survey. Our analysis also includes the application of Gaussian Process approach to take into account stellar activity induced radial velocity variations, and improve the detection limits, around the most-observed and most-active targets. The Markov chain Monte Carlo and Gaussian process technique we apply in this analysis has proven very effective in the study of M-dwarf planetary systems, helping the detection of most of the HADES planets. From the detectability function we can calculate the occurrence rate of small mass planets around early-M dwarfs, either taking into account only the 11 already published HADES planets or adding also the 5 new planetary candidates discovered in this analysis, and compare them with the previous estimates of planet occurrence around M-dwarf or Solar-type stars: considering only the confirmed planets, we find the highest frequency for low-mass planets (\$1\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus {\textless} m\_p {\textbackslash}sin i {\textless} 10\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$) with periods \$10\$ d\$ {\textless} P {\textless} 100\$ d, \$f\_{\textbackslash}text\{occ\} = 85{\textasciicircum}\{+5\}\_\{-19\}{\textbackslash}\%\$, while for short-period planets (\$1\$ d\$ {\textless} P {\textless} 10\$ d) we find a frequency of \$f\_{\textbackslash}text\{occ\} = 10.3{\textasciicircum}\{+8.4\}\_\{-3.3\}{\textbackslash}\%\$, significantly lower than for later-M dwarfs. These results, and their comparison with other surveys focused on different stellar types, confirms the central role that stellar mass plays in the formation and evolution of planetary systems.},

	abstract = {AU Mic b is a Neptune-sized planet on an 8.47-day orbit around the nearest pre-main sequence ({\textasciitilde}20 Myr) star to the Sun, the bright (V = 8.81) M dwarf AU Mic. The planet was preliminary detected in Doppler radial velocity time series and recently confirmed to be transiting with data from the TESS mission. AU Mic b is likely to be cooling and contracting and might be accompanied by a second, more massive planet, in an outer orbit. Here, we present the observations of the transit of AU Mic b using ESPRESSO on the Very Large Telescope. We obtained a high-resolution time series of spectra to measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, to constrain the spin-orbit alignment of the star and planet, and to simultaneously attempt to retrieve the planet's atmospheric transmission spectrum. These observations allowed us to study, for the first time, the early phases of the dynamical evolution of young systems. We applied different methodologies to derive the spin-orbit angle of AU Mic b, and all of them retrieve values consistent with the planet being aligned with the rotation plane of the star. We determined a conservative spin-orbit angle λ value of -2.96{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-10.30{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+10.44{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} degrees, indicative that the formation and migration of the planets of the AU Mic system occurred within the disc. Unfortunately, and despite the large signal-to-noise ratio of our measurements, the degree of stellar activity prevented us from detecting any features from the planetary atmosphere. In fact, our results suggest that transmission spectroscopy for recently formed planets around active young stars is going to remain very challenging, if at all possible, for the near future.},

	abstract = {Ask a scientist about Hollywood, and you’ll probably get eye rolls. But ask someone in Hollywood about science, and they’ll see dollar signs: moviemakers know that science can be the source of great stories, with all the drama and action that blockbusters require.   That’s a huge mistake, says Randy Olson: Hollywood has a lot to teach scientists about how to tell a story—and, ultimately, how to do science better. With Houston, We Have a Narrative, he lays out a stunningly simple method for turning the dull into the dramatic. Drawing on his unique background, which saw him leave his job as a working scientist to launch a career as a filmmaker, Olson first diagnoses the problem: When scientists tell us about their work, they pile one moment and one detail atop another moment and another detail—a stultifying procession of “and, and, and.” What we need instead is an understanding of the basic elements of story, the narrative structures that our brains are all but hardwired to look for—which Olson boils down, brilliantly, to “And, But, Therefore,” or ABT. At a stroke, the ABT approach introduces momentum (“And”), conflict (“But”), and resolution (“Therefore”)—the fundamental building blocks of story. As Olson has shown by leading countless workshops worldwide, when scientists’ eyes are opened to ABT, the effect is staggering: suddenly, they’re not just talking about their work—they’re telling stories about it. And audiences are captivated.   Written with an uncommon verve and enthusiasm, and built on principles that are applicable to fields far beyond science, Houston, We Have a Narrative has the power to transform the way science is understood and appreciated, and ultimately how it’s done.},

	abstract = {We report on the results of an 8-year survey carried out at the La Silla Observatory with the HARPS spectrograph to detect and characterize planets in the super-Earth and Neptune mass regime. The size of our star sample and the precision achieved with HARPS have allowed the detection of a sufficiently large number of low-mass planets to study the statistical properties of their orbital elements, the correlation of the host-star metallicity with the planet masses, as well as the occurrence rate of planetary systems around solar-type stars. A robust estimate of the frequency of systems shows that more than 50\% of solar-type stars harbor at least one planet of any mass and with period up to 100 days. Different properties are observed for the population of planets less massive than about 30M-Earth compared to the population of gaseous giant planets. The mass distribution of Super-Earths and Neptune-mass planets (SEN) is strongly increasing between 30 and 15M-Earth. The SEN occurence rate does not exhibit a preference for metal rich stars. Most of the SEN planets belong to multi-planetary systems. The orbital eccentricities of the SEN planets seems limited to 0.45. At the opposite, the occurence rate of gaseous giant planets is growing with the logarithm of the period, and is strongly increasing with the host-star metallicity. About 14\% of solar-type stars have a planetary companion more massive than 50M-Earth? on an orbit with a period shorter than 10 years. Orbital eccentricities of giant planets are observed up to 0.9 and beyond. The precision of HARPS-type spectrographs opens the possibility to detect planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars. Identification of a significant number of super-Earths orbiting solar-type of the Sun vicinity is achieved by Doppler spectroscopy. 37 newly discovered planets are announced in the Appendix of this paper, among which 15 Super-Earths.},

In these proceedings, we present the highest-time cadence ( 1 s), highest signal-to-noise ( 100) constraints on the optical color temperature evolution during the rise phase of a large, impulsive-type dMe flare event. The flare exhibits compelling evidence of a hot, color temperature (T 10,000 K), but the Balmer jump ratios show that the flare cannot be explained by isothermal slabs or blackbody surfaces at any time in the evolution.

In a companion paper, we reported detections of the planet radial velocity (RV) signatures of the two close-in transiting planets of the system, with respective semi-amplitudes of 5.8 ± 2.5 and 8.5 ± 2.5 m s-1 for AU Mic b and AU Mic c. Here, we perform an independent measurement of the RV semi-amplitude of AU Mic c using Doppler imaging to simultaneously model the activity-induced distortions and the planet-induced shifts in the line profiles. The resulting semi-amplitude of 13.3 ± 4.1 m s-1 for AU Mic c reinforces the idea that the planet features a surprisingly large inner density, in tension with current standard models of core accretion. Our brightness maps feature significantly higher spot coverage and lower level of differential rotation than the brightness maps obtained in late 2019 with the SPIRou spectropolarimeter, suggesting that the stellar magnetic activity has evolved dramatically over a {\textasciitilde}1-yr time span.

	abstract = {Tidal interaction between an exoplanet and its host star is a possible pathway to transfer angular momentum between the planetary orbit and the stellar spin. In cases where the planetary orbital period is shorter than the stellar rotation period, this may lead to angular momentum being transferred into the star's rotation, possibly counteracting the intrinsic stellar spin-down induced by magnetic braking. Observationally, detecting altered rotational states of single, cool field stars is challenging, as precise ages for such stars are rarely available. Here we present an empirical investigation of the rotation and magnetic activity of a sample of planet-hosting stars that are accompanied by wide stellar companions. Without needing knowledge about the absolute ages of the stars, we test for relative differences in activity and rotation of the planet hosts and their co-eval companions, using X-ray observations to measure the stellar activity levels. Employing three different tidal interaction models, we find that host stars with planets that are expected to tidally interact display elevated activity levels compared to their companion stars. We also find that those activity levels agree with the observed rotational periods for the host stars along the usual rotation-activity relationships, implying that the effect is indeed caused by a tidal interaction and not a purely magnetic interaction that would be expected to affect the stellar activity, but not necessarily the rotation. We conclude that massive, close-in planets have an impact on the stellar rotational evolution, while the smaller, more distant planets do not have a significant influence.},

The way in which stellar rotation and magnetism break this symmetry places important observational constraints on stellar magnetic fields, and factors in the assessment of the impact of stellar activity on exoplanet atmospheres. The spatial distribution of flares on the solar surface is well known to be nonuniform, but elusive on other stars. We briefly review the techniques available to recover the loci of stellar flares, and highlight a new method that enables systematic flare localization directly from optical light curves. We provide an estimate of the number of flares we may be able to localize with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, and show that it is consistent with the results obtained from the first full sky scan of the mission. We suggest that nonuniform flare latitude distributions need to be taken into account in accurate assessments of exoplanet habitability.},

The resulting latitudinal emergence patterns at the stellar surface are compared with observed distributions of starspots in stellar latitude. The stellar models considered cover the range of evolutionary stages from shortly after the Hayashi phase down to the ZAMS, i.e. from the classical and weak-line T Tauri stars to the alpha -Persei stars. We use numerical simulations to follow the evolution of magnetic flux tubes from their origin at the bottom of the convection zone up to near-surface layers. We find a strong increase of emergence latitude with increasing rotation rate, a moderate decrease with increasing stellar mass, and a stronger decrease with stellar age. At very early evolutionary stages, when the central radiative zone is still quite small, we find magnetic flux emergence both in low latitudes as well as in the polar areas. High-latitude emergence is predicted in slightly more evolved pre-main-sequence and young main-sequence stars, but truly polar spots on these stars require an additional transport mechanism acting after magnetic flux emergence at the surface, probably meridional circulation or poleward slip of the `anchored' part of the erupted flux tubes. We discuss our findings in the light of the results obtained from Doppler-imaging studies.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13615},
	abstract = {Impulsive short term variations occur in all kinds of solar-type stars. They are the results of complex phenomena such as the stellar magnetic field reconnection, low-level variability or in some cases even star-planet interactions. The radiation arising from these events is often highly energetic and, in stars hosting planets, may interact with the planetary atmospheres. Studying the rate of these energetic phenomena is fundamental to understand their role in modifying the chemical composition or, in some extreme cases, to the disruption of the planetary atmospheres. Here, we present a new procedure developed to identify the impulsive events in TESS light curves. Our goal is to have a simple and effective tool to study the short-term activity of a star using only its light curve, in order to derive its distribution and energetic. As our first case, we studied the system DS Tuc. Our technique consists of fitting the TESS light curves using iteratively Gaussian processes in order to remove all the long-term stellar activity contributions. Then, we identify the impulsive events and, derive amplitudes, time scales and the amount of energy emitted. We validate our procedure using the AU Mic TESS light curves obtaining results consistent with those presented in the literature. We estimate the frequency distribution of energetic events for DS Tuc. In particular, we find that there are approx 2 events per day with energy greater than 2x10{\textasciicircum}32 erg. We find evidence for a favoured stellar phase for short term activity on AU Mic, and also indications of short term activity in phase with the planetary orbit. For DS Tuc we find that the events distribution is not equally spaced in time but often grouped. The resulting distribution may be used to estimate the impact of short term variability on planetary atmosphere chemical compositions.},

These observations have already yielded 2,496 scientific publications by authors from 63 countries. The full data set is now public and available from NASA's data archives, enabling continued investigations and discoveries of exoplanets, oscillating stars, eclipsing binaries, stellar variability, star clusters, supernovae, galaxies, asteroids, and much more. In this white paper, we discuss 21 important data analysis projects which are enabled by the archive data. The aim of this paper is to help new users understand where there may be important scientific gains left to be made in analyzing Kepler data, and to encourage the continued use of the archives. With the TESS mission about to start releasing data, the studies will inform new experiments, new surveys, and new analysis techniques. The Kepler mission has provided an unprecedented data set with a precision and duration that will not be rivaled for decades. The studies discussed in this paper show that many of Kepler's contributions still lie ahead of us, owing to the emergence of complementary new data sets like Gaia, novel data analysis methods, and advances in computing power. Kepler's unique data archive will provide new discoveries for years to come, touching upon key aspects of each of NASA's three big astrophysics questions; How does the universe work? How did we get here? Are we alone?},

	abstract = {We have carried out plasma diagnostics of solar flares using soft X-ray (SXR) and simultaneous microwave observations and have compared the ratio of X-ray to microwave luminosities of solar flares with various active late-type stars available in the published literature. Both the SXR low-level (`quiescent') emission from stellar coronae and the flaring emission from the Sun and stars are generally interpreted as thermal radiations of coronal plasmas. On the other hand, the microwave emission of stars and solar flares is generally attributed to an extremely hot or nonthermal population of electrons. Solar flare SXR are conventionally measured in a narrower and harder passband than the stellar sources. Observations of the GOES-2 satellite in two energy channels have been used to estimate the luminosity of solar flares as it would appear in the ROSAT satellite passband. The solar and stellar flare luminosities fit well at the lower end of the active stellar coronae. The flare SXR/microwave ratio is similar to the ratio for stellar coronae. The average ratio follows a power-law relation L\_X\_\{prop.to\}L\_R\_{\textasciicircum}0.73+/-0.03{\textasciicircum} over 10 orders of magnitude from solar microflares to RS CVn and FK Com-type coronae. Dwarf Me and Ke stars, and RS CVn stars are also compatible with a linear SXR/microwave relation, but the ratio is slightly different for each type of star. Considering the differences between solar flares, stellar flares and the various active stellar coronae, the similarity of the SXR/microwave ratios is surprising. It suggests that the energetic electrons in low-level stellar coronae observed in microwaves are related in a similar way to the coronal thermal plasma as flare electrons to the flare thermal plasma, and, consequently, that the heating mechanism of active stellar coronae is a flare-like process.},

We detect several periodic, coherent pulses occurring over a time-scale consistent with the rotational period of UV Ceti. The properties of the pulsed emission show that they originate from the electron cyclotron maser instability, in a cavity at least 7 orders of magnitude less dense than the mean coronal density at the estimated source altitude. These results confirm that auroral activity can occur in active M dwarfs, suggesting that these stars mark the beginning of the transition from solar-like to auroral magnetospheric behaviour.

However, previous TESS studies have found ultra fast rotating (UFR) M dwarfs with periods less than 1 d displaying low levels of flaring activity. As a result, in this study, we utilize VLT/FORS2 spectro-polarimetric data of 10 M dwarf UFR stars between spectral types {\textasciitilde}M2-M6 all with Prot {\textless} 1, to detect the presence of a magnetic field. We divide our sample into rotation period bins of equal size, with one star having many more flares in the TESS light curve than the other. We also provide an analysis of the long-term variability within our sample using TESS light curves taken during Cycles 1 and 3 (up to 3 yr apart). We identify 605 flares from our sample which have energies between 2.0 × 1031 and 5.4 × 1034 erg. Although we find no significant difference in the flare rate between the Cycles, two of our targets display changes in their light-curve morphology, potentially caused by a difference in the spot distribution. Overall, we find five stars (50 per cent) in our sample have a detectable magnetic field with strengths {\textasciitilde}1-2 kG. Of these five, four were the more flare active stars within the period bins with one being the less flare active star. It would appear the magnetic field strength may not be the answer to the lack of flaring activity and supersaturation or magnetic field configuration may play a role. However, it is clear the relationship between rotation and activity is more complex than a steady decrease over time.},

The distribution of apparent speeds and the fraction of CMEs showing acceleration were also in agreement with earlier reports. The pointing stability provided by an L-1 orbit and the use of CCD detectors have resulted in superior brightness sensitivity for LASCO over earlier coronagraphs; however, we have not detected a significant population of fainter (i.e., low mass) CMEs. The general shape of the distribution of apparent sizes for LASCO CMEs is similar to those of earlier reports, but the average (median) apparent size of 72° (50°) is significantly larger. The larger average apparent size is predominantly the result of the detection of a population of partial and complete halo CMEs, at least some of which appear to be events with a significant longitudinal component directed along the Sun-Earth line, either toward or away from the Earth. Using full disk solar images obtained by the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) on SOHO, we found that 40 out of 92 of these events might have been directed toward the Earth, and we compared the timing of those with the Kp geomagnetic storm index in the days following the CME. Although the ``false alarm'' rate was high, we found that 15 out of 21 (71\%) of the Kp{\textgreater}=6 storms could be accounted for as SOHO LASCO/EIT frontside halo CMEs. If we eliminate three Kp storms that occurred following LASCO/EIT data gaps, then the possible association rate was 15 out of 18 (83\%).},

	abstract = {Terrestrial planets are easier to detect around M dwarfs than other types of stars, making them promising for next-generation atmospheric characterization studies. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has greatly increased the number of known M-dwarf planets that we can use to perform population studies, allowing us to explore how the rocky planet occurrence rate varies with host radius, following in the footsteps of past work with Kepler data. In this paper, we use simulations to assess TESS's yield of small (0.5 R ⊕ {\textless} R p {\textless} 2 R ⊕) planet candidates around nearby (d {\textless} 30 pc) M dwarfs. We highlight the underappreciated fact that, while TESS was indeed expected to find a large number of planets around M dwarfs overall, it was not expected to have a high planetary yield for the latest M dwarfs. Furthermore, we find that TESS has detected fewer planets around stars with R ⋆ {\textless} 0.3 R ⊙ than even was expected (11 observed versus 24 ± 5 expected). We find evidence that the photometric noise of stars in the TESS bandpass increases with decreasing radius for M dwarfs. However, this trend cannot explain the observed distribution of planets. Our main conclusions are (1) the planet occurrence rate likely does not increase, and may decrease for the latest M dwarfs; and (2) there are at least 17, and potentially three times that number, transiting planets around nearby late-M dwarfs that still will not be detected by the end of TESS's fourth year.},

Due to their physical characteristics and proximity to the central star, HJs are the natural laboratories to study the process of star-planet interaction (SPI). Phenomena related to SPI may include the inflation and the evaporation of planetary atmospheres, the formation of cometary tails and bow shocks and magnetospheric interaction between the magnetic field of the planet and that of the star. Several works suggest that some systems show enhanced stellar activity in phase with the planetary rotation period. In this work, we use a 3D magneto-hydrodynamic model that describes a system composed of a star and an HJ and that includes the corresponding planetary and stellar winds. The aim is to investigate whether the material evaporating from the planet interacts with the stellar extended corona, and generates observable features. Our simulation shows that, in some conditions, the planetary wind expands and propagates mainly along the planetary orbit. Moreover, part of the planetary wind collides with the stellar wind and a fraction of the planet's outflow is funnelled by the stellar magnetic field and hits the stellar surface. In both events, the material is heated up to temperatures of a few MK by a shock. These phenomena could manifest in the form of enhanced stellar activity at some orbital phases of the planet.},

	abstract = {Self-organized criticality describes a class of dynamical systems that maintain themselves in an attractor state with no intrinsic length or timescale. Fundamentally, this theoretical construct requires a mechanism for instability that may trigger additional instabilities locally via dissipative processes. This concept has been invoked to explain nonlinear dynamical phenomena such as featureless energy spectra that have been observed empirically for earthquakes, avalanches, and solar flares. If this interpretation proves correct, it implies that the solar coronal magnetic field maintains itself in a critical state via a delicate balance between the dynamo-driven injection of magnetic energy and the release of that energy via flaring events. All-sky high-cadence surveys like the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) provide the necessary data to compare the energy distribution of flaring events in stars of different spectral types to that observed in the Sun. We identified {\textasciitilde}106 flaring events on {\textasciitilde}105 stars observed by TESS at a 2 minute cadence. By fitting the flare frequency distribution for different mass bins, we find that all main-sequence stars exhibit distributions of flaring events similar to that observed in the Sun, independent of their mass or age. This may suggest that stars universally maintain a critical state in their coronal topologies via magnetic reconnection events. If this interpretation proves correct, we may be able to infer properties of magnetic fields, interior structure, and dynamo mechanisms for stars that are otherwise unresolved point sources.},

	abstract = {Flares are magnetic reconnection events in the atmospheres of cool stars that lead to a myriad of observed emission, including broadband optical flux increases that can be more than 100 times the quiescent flux of the star. We have obtained nearly 1000 hours of photometric monitoring of 39 dwarf stars, both magnetically active and inactive, with spectral types from M0 to M8, to measure their flare frequency distributions (FFDs - the frequency of flares of various energies). The quantitative algorithm we developed for flare identification makes no assumptions about flare shapes and uses the noise characteristics of the light curves to determine the minimum flare energy that can be detected. We identify 239 flares, from which we present the first FFD measurements for both inactive and active early-type stars; inactive, mid-type stars; and active, late-type stars. We also measure FFDs for active, mid-type M dwarfs that compare well with previous studies. A subset of 137 flares were determined to be classical type flares, which we use to investigate the rise times, peak magnitudes, decay times, and total energies. We adopt an analytic flare shape model, and then use the measured FFDs and measured distributions of rise and decay times to construct simulated light curves appropriate for stars with specified spectral types and magnetic activity levels. We use the Galactic stellar population model Galfast to generate volume-limited catalogs of stars in the Milky Way. By constructing light curves with the appropriate FFDs for each star in the catalog, we can model the flare rates for time-domain photometric surveys. The Galactic flare rate model was compared to flares identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82, allowing us to calibrate the model parameters. When applied to the survey characteristics of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the model predicts that there will be several flares with u-band enhancements of more than 0.1 magnitudes in every 9.6 deg² full-frame exposure at low Galactic latitudes. The model further predicts that M dwarf flaring will cause ∼1\% of LSST u-band images to contain an optical transient - a large flare on an M dwarf that is too faint to be seen in any filter during quiescence.},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PhDT.......177D},
	abstract = {Time domain photometric surveys for large numbers of stars have ushered in a new era of statistical studies of astrophysics. This new parameter space allows us to observe how stars behave and change on a human timescale, and facilitates ensemble studies to understand how stars change over cosmic timescales. With current and planned time domain stellar surveys, we will be able to put the Sun in a Galactic context, and discover how typical or unique our parent star truly is. The goal of this thesis is to develop techniques for detecting and analyzing the most prominent forms of magnetic activity from low-mass stars in modern time domain surveys: starspots and flares. Magnetic field strength is a fundamental property that decays over a star's life. As a result, flux modulations from both flares and starspots become smaller amplitude and more infrequent in light curves. Methods for detecting these forms of magnetic activity will be extensible to future time domain surveys, and helpful in characterizing the properties of stars as they age. Flares can be detected in sparsely sampled wide field surveys by searching for bright single-point outliers in light curves. Using both red optical and near infrared data from ground-based surveys over many years, I have constrained the rate of flares in multiple wavelengths for an ensemble of M dwarfs. Studying flares in these existing ground-based datasets will enable predictions for future survey yields. Space-based photometry enables continuous and precise monitoring of stars for many years, which is crucial for obtaining a complete census of flares from a single star. Using 11 months of 1-minute photometry for the M dwarf GJ 1243, I have amassed over 6100 flare events, the largest sample of white light flares for any low-mass star. I have also created the first high fidelity empirical white light flare template, which shows three distinct phases in typical flare light curves. With this template, I demonstrate that complex multi-peaked flares can be decomposed into their constituent flare events. This is the first modern study of the detailed white light morphology of stellar flares. Space-based survey data is also ideal for studying starspots, whose photometric mod- ulation amplitude is typically much smaller than for flares. Using 4 years of 30 minute photometry for GJ 1243, I have traced the sizes and longitudes for multiple large starspots. A primary starspot is found that is stable in position and size over the 4 years of data, as well as secondary starspot features that decay on 100 to 500 day timescales and evolve in longitude. The secular longitude evolution of the secondary starspots indicates a very low rate of differential rotation on this rapidly rotating low-mass star. The presence of a transiting exoplanet can provide a great deal of information about the sizes and locations of starspots on the host star. When the planet crosses in front of a starspot, a small deviation in the predicted transit light curve is observed. By tracing these transit anomalies, I have detected more than 100 distinct starspots in 4 years of data on the young G2 dwarf, Kepler 17. These starspots are up to an order of magnitude larger than those on the Sun, and this star shows an almost four times larger amplitude of differential rotation than on the Sun.},

We discover degeneracy present at 2 minute cadence between sharply peaked and weakly peaked flares is common, although 20 s cadence breaks these degeneracies. We better resolve the rise phases and find 46\% of large flares exhibit substructure during the rise phase. We observe 49 candidate quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) and confirm 17 at ≥3σ. Most of our QPPs have periods less than 10 minutes, suggesting short-period optical QPPs are common. We find QPPs in both the rise and decay phases of flares, including a rise-phase QPP in a large flare from Proxima Cen. We confirm that the Davenport et al. template provides a good fit to most classical flares observed at high cadence, although 9\% favor Gaussian peaks instead. We characterize the properties of complex flares, finding 17\% of complex flares exhibit "peak-bump" morphologies composed of a large, highly impulsive peak followed by a second, more gradual Gaussian peak. We also estimate the UVC surface fluences of temperate planets at flare peak and find one-third of 1034 erg flares reach the D90 dose of Deinococcus radiodurans in just 20 s in the absence of an atmosphere.},

In parallel, substantial theoretical developments have been carried out in the last few years, including the physics of the star-disk interaction, numerical simulations of stellar winds, and the investigation of angular momentum transport processes in stellar interiors. This chapter reviews both the recent observational and theoretical advances that prompted the development of renewed angular momentum evolution models for cool stars and brown dwarfs.

The instrument has four modes, each with object and sky fibres: Low (R{\textasciitilde}15000), Medium (R{\textasciitilde}40000) and High Resolution (R{\textasciitilde}65000), as well as a High Stability mode for enhanced radial velocity precision at R{\textasciitilde}65000. The High Stability mode contains a fibre double-scrambler and offers optional simultaneous Th-Ar arc injection, or the inclusion of an iodine cell in the beam. The LR mode has unsliced 500μm fibres and makes provision for nod-and-shuffle for improved background subtraction. The MR mode also uses 500μm fibres, while the HR and HS fibres are 350μm. The latter three modes employ modified Bowen-Walraven image-slicers to subdivide each fibre into three slices. All but the High Stability bench is sealed within a vacuum tank, which itself is enclosed in an interlocking Styrostone enclosure, to insulate the spectrograph against temperature and atmospheric pressure variations. The Fibre Instrument Feed (FIF) couples the four pairs of fibres to the telescope focal plane and allows the selection of the appropriate fibre pair for a given mode, and adjustment of the fibre separation to optimally position the sky fibre. The HRS employs a photomultiplier tube for an exposure meter and has a dedicated auto-guider attached to the FIF.

	abstract = {In the broadest sense, the primary goal of exoplanet demographic surveys is to determine the frequency and distribution of planets as a function of as many of the physical parameters that may influence planet formation and evolution as possible, over as broad of a range of these parameters as possible. Empirically-determined exoplanet demographics provide the ground truth that all planet formation and evolution theories must reproduce. By comparing these planet distributions to the predictions of planet formation theories, we can begin to both test and refine these theories. In this chapter, we review the major results on exoplanet demographics to date. In this context, we identify a set of important open questions that remain to be answered. We outline the challenges of measuring the demographics of exoplanets using the variety of detection methods at our disposal. Finally, we summarize some of the future opportunities for refining and expanding our understanding of exoplanet demographics.},

	abstract = {At a distance of only 1.3 pc, Proxima Cen is the closest exoplanetary system orbiting an M-type flare star, making it a benchmark case to explore the properties and potential effects of stellar activity on exoplanet atmospheres. In April-July 2019, we observed Proxima Cen for roughly 40 hours with ground- and space-based facilities spanning the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Simultaneous data is available from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), the du Pont telescope at Las Campanas, the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope (LCOGT), the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), Swift, and Chandra. I will present the initial results of this survey, which are already challenging our understanding of flare mechanisms and energetics. For many detected flares, millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each other closely while optical emission is delayed, suggesting that millimeter emission could serve as a better proxy for FUV emission from stellar flares and become a powerful new tool to constrain the high-energy radiation environment of exoplanets.},

The larger flare had a duration of only ∼35 s, with peak LR = 2 × 1015 erg s−1 Hz−1, and lower limit on linear polarization of . We examine the characteristics common to these new AU Mic events and those from Proxima Cen previously reported in MacGregor et al.—namely short durations, negative spectral indices, and significant linear polarization—to provide new diagnostics of conditions in outer stellar atmospheres and details of stellar flare particle acceleration. The event rates (∼20 and 4 events days−1 for AU Mic and Proxima Cen, respectively) suggest that millimeter flares occur commonly but have been undetected until now. Analysis of the flare observing frequency and consideration of possible incoherent emission mechanisms confirms the presence of MeV electrons in the stellar atmosphere occurring as part of the flare process. The spectral indices point to a hard distribution of electrons. The short durations and lack of pronounced exponential decay in the light curve are consistent with formation in a simple magnetic loop, with radio emission predominating from directly precipitating electrons. We consider the possibility of both synchrotron and gyrosynchrotron emission mechanisms, although synchrotron is favored given the linear polarization signal. This would imply that the emission must be occurring in a low density environment of only modest magnetic field strength. A deeper understanding of this newly discovered and apparently common stellar flare mechanism awaits more observations with better-studied flare components at other wavelengths.},

Some superflares show multiple peaks with the peak separation of the order of 100 to 1,000 s which is comparable to the periods of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar flares. Using these new data combined with the results from the data with 30-min sampling, we found that the occurrence frequency (dN/dE) of superflares as a function of flare energy ( E) shows the power-law distribution (dN/dE∝ E {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}- α {\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) with α∼-1.5 for 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}33{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}\&lt; E\&lt;10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}36{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg which is consistent with the previous results. The average occurrence rate of superflares with the energy of 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}33{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg which is equivalent to X100 solar flares is about once in 500 to 600 years. The upper limit of energy released by superflares is basically comparable to a fraction of the magnetic energy stored near starspots which is estimated from the photometry. We also found that the duration of superflares ( τ) increases with the flare energy ( E) as τ∝ E {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}0.39 ± 0.03{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {Context: The young binary system V773 Tau A exhibits a persistent radio flaring activity that gradually increases from a level of a few mJy at apoastron to more than 100 mJy at periastron. Interbinary collisions between very large (\&gt;15{\textasciitilde}R\_*) magnetic structures anchored on the two rotating stars of the system have been proposed to be the origin of these periodic radio flares. Magnetic structures extended over tens of stellar radii, that can also account for the observed fast decay of the radio flares, seem to correspond to the typical solar semi-open quite extended magnetic configurations called helmet streamers. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Aims: We aim to find direct observational evidence for the postulated, solar-like, coronal topologies. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: We performed seven-consecutive-day VLBI observations at 8.4 GHz using an array consisting of the VLBA and the 100-m Effelsberg telescope. {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}V773 Tau{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} A was phase-referenced to QSO B0400+258. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: Two distinctive structures appear in the radio images here presented. They happen to be associated with the primary and secondary stars of the {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}V773 Tau{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} A system. In one image (Fig. 2B) the two features are extended up to 18{\textasciitilde}R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} each and are nearly parallel revealing the presence of two interacting helmet streamers. One image (Fig. 2E) taken a few hours after a flare monitored by the 100-m Effelsberg telescope shows one elongated fading structure substantially rotated with respect to those seen in the B run. The same decay scenario is seen in Fig. 2G for the helmet streamer associated with the other star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: This is the very first direct evidence revealing that even if the flare origin is magnetic reconnection due to interbinary collision, both stars independently emit in the radio range with structures of their own. These structures are helmet streamers, observed for the first time in stars other than the Sun. The complete extent of each helmet streamer above the stellar surface is about 24 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}*{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} which implies that they can practically interact throughout the whole orbit, even rather close to apoastron where the stellar separation is 52{\textasciitilde}R\_*. However, the radio flares become stronger when the stars approach. Around periastron the stellar separation is only 30{\textasciitilde}R\_*, nearly covered by a single streamer: the two streamers overlap producing the observed giant flares.},

An elementary derivation is presented of the perturbing tidal forces, and the perturbations are used to derive differential equations for the evolution of several orbital and rotational parameters of the binary system. Energy and angular momentum considerations are used directly instead of the general perturbation techniques of celestial mechanics. The tidal evolution equations are analyzed locally around equilibrium configurations. Time scales are derived for the rate of change of the semimajor axis, the rotational velocity, and for the eccentricity and inclination, which go to zero asymptotically. The global aspects of the tidal evolution equations are analyzed. For the case of small inclinations but arbitrary eccentricity, a complete classification is made of all types of tidal evolution possible in the model which is presented. Several relations are obtained analytically from the equations for tidal evolution in the weak friction model. The presented model is simple, but it is sufficiently general to be applicable to a wide class of binary stars},

We report here the results obtained from 4092 homogeneous radius measurements at 30{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}o{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and 60{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}o{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} zenith distances. The data set shows at both zenith distances a significant radius variation in phase with magnetic activity. Moreover, the observations at 30{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}o{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, which are less affected by atmospheric noise, give a significantly higher correlation coefficient between radius variation and sunspot numbers. Other investigations of solar radius variations during the last decades based on different observing techniques, as well as two analyses of historical data, are commented. Most of them show also positive correlations between radius variation and solar activity. With the noted exception of Calern, France, the results obtained at other astrolabe stations during recent years are in agreement with Santiago. The discrepancy between Calern and Santiago and its probable cause are discussed.},

	abstract = {Protostellar jets most probably originate in turbulent accretion disks surrounding young stellar objects. We investigate the evolution of a disk wind into a collimated jet under the influence of magnetic diffusivity, assuming that the turbulent pattern in the disk will also enter the disk corona and the jet. Using the ZEUS-3D code in the axisymmetry option we solve the time-dependent resistive MHD equations for a model setup of a central star surrounded by an accretion disk. The disk is taken as a time-independent boundary condition for the mass flow rate and the magnetic flux distribution. We derive analytical estimates for the magnitude of magnetic diffusion in a protostellar jet connecting our results to earlier work in the limit of ideal MHD. We find that the diffusive jets propagate slower into the ambient medium, most probably due to the lower mass flow rate in the axial direction. Close to the star we find that a quasi stationary state evolves after several hundred (weak diffusion) or thousand (strong diffusion) disk rotations. Magnetic diffusivity affects the protostellar jet structure as follows. The jet poloidal magnetic field becomes de-collimated. The jet velocity increases with increasing diffusivity, while the degree of collimation for the hydrodynamic flow remains more or less the same. We suggest that the mass flux is a proper tracer for the degree of jet collimation and find indications of a critical value for the magnetic diffusivity above which the jet collimation is only weak. We finally develop a self-consistent picture in which all these effects can be explained in the framework of the Lorentz force.},

	abstract = {Solar flare observations in the deka-keV range are performed by the WATCH experiment on board the GRANAT satellite. The WATCH experiment is presented, including the energy calibration as applied in the present work. The creation of the solar burst catalogue covering two years of observation is described and some examples of solar observations are given. The estimated energy releases in the flares presented here are found to extend below the range of hard X-ray flares which were previously studied by ISEE-3 and HXRBS/SMM detectors. The X-ray emitting component cannot be exclusively explained by contributions from a thermal plasma around a few keV. Either a hotter component or a non-thermal population of particles must also be present to produce the observed deka-keV emission. The WATCH data furthermore shows that the relative contributions of these components may change during an event or from event to event and that the injection of energy contained in suprathermal electrons may occur throughout an event and not only during the rise phase. For the most energetic WATCH flares simultaneous observations performed by other experiments at higher energies further indicate that non-thermal emission can be observed as low as 10 keV. A statistical study is performed on the total WATCH solar database and frequency distributions are built on measured X-ray flare parameters. It is also investigated how the properties of these frequency distributions behave when subgroups of events defined by different ranges of parameters are considered. No correlation is found between the elapsed time interval between successive flares arising from the same active region and the peak intensity of the flare.},

Fast magnetoacoustic oscillations of a non-flaring loop can interact with a nearby flaring active region. This interaction occurs when part of the oscillation situated outside the loop reaches the regions of steep gradients in magnetic field within an active region and produces periodic variations of electric current density. The modulation depth of these variations is a few orders of magnitude greater than the amplitude of the driving oscillation. The variations of the current can induce current-driven plasma micro-instabilities and thus anomalous resistivity. This can periodically trigger magnetic reconnection, and hence acceleration of charged particles, producing quasi-periodic pulsations of X-ray, optical and radio emission at the arcade footpoints.},

In particular, stellar X-rays and UV emission have a strong impact on the dynamical and chemical evolution of planetary atmospheres. We analyzed 25 XMM-Newton observations encompassing about eight years and totaling about 958 ks in order to study the X-ray emission of HD 189733 A. We find that the corona of HD 189733 A has an average temperature of 0.4 keV and it is only during flares that the mean temperature increases to 0.9 keV. Apart from the flares, there is no significant change in the flux and hardness of the coronal emission on a timescale of several months to years. Thus, we conclude that there is no detectable activity cycle on such timescales. We identified the flares and built their energy distribution. The number of flares observed around the phases of the planetary eclipses is not statistically different from the number of flares during transit phases. However, we do find a hint of a difference in the flare-energy distributions, as the flares observed around the planetary eclipses tend to be more energetic than the flares observed around the primary transits of the planet. We modeled the distribution of the number of flares per day with a power law, showing that it is steeper than the one observed in the Sun and in other Main Sequence stars. The steepness hints at a significant fraction of undetected micro-flares. Altogether, the plasma temperatures below 1 keV observed during the flares, along with the slightly larger fraction of energetic flares seen at the secondary transits highlight the peculiarity of the corona of HD 189733 A and points to star-planet interaction as the plausible origin of part of its X-ray emission. However, more observational and modeling efforts are required to confirm or disprove this scenario.},

The structure of the X-ray lightcurves observed in this selection of flare events is untypical in that the maximum emission extends over several hours producing a round hump in the lightcurve instead of a sharp peak. We explain this deviation from the standard shape of a flare lightcurve as the result of a flare erupting on the back side of the star and gradually moving into the line of sight due to the star's rotation. Making use of the known rotational periods of the stars our model allows to determine the decay timescale of the flares and the size of the X-ray emitting volume according to the standard magnetic loop model. Spectral information, which is available in sufficient quality for the Algol observation only, supports our proposition that changes of the visible volume are responsible for the observed time development of these flares.},

The calculations include a detailed non-equilibrium treatment of hydrogen, calcium, and helium. Next to an hour long simulation sequence, additional simulations are produced, for which the stratification is slightly perturbed so that a ionisation relaxation timescale can be determined. The simulations are characterised by upwards propagating shock waves, which cause strong temperature fluctuations and variations of the (non-equilibrium) ionisation degree of calcium. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The passage of a hot shock front leads to a strong net ionisation of Ca II, rapidly followed by net recombination. The relaxation timescale of the calcium ionisation state is found to be of the order of a few seconds at the top of the photosphere and 10 to 30 s in the upper chromosphere. At heights around 1 Mm, we find typical values around 60 s and in extreme cases up to {\textasciitilde}150 s. Generally, the timescales are significantly reduced in the wakes of ubiquitous hot shock fronts. The timescales can be reliably determined from a simple analysis of the eigenvalues of the transition rate matrix. The timescales are dominated by the radiative recombination from Ca III into the metastable Ca II energy levels of the 4d {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}D term. These transitions depend strongly on the density of free electrons and therefore on the (non-equilibrium) ionisation degree of hydrogen, which is the main electron donor.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The ionisation/recombination timescales derived here are too long for the assumption of an instantaneous ionisation equilibrium to be valid and, on the other hand, are not long enough to warrant an assumption of a constant ionisation fraction. Fortunately, the ionisation degree of Ca ii remains small in the height range, where the cores of the H, K, and the infrared triplet lines are formed. We conclude that the difference due to a detailed treatment of Ca ionisation has only negligible impact on the modelling of spectral lines of Ca ii and the plasma properties under the conditions in the quiet solar chromosphere.},

	abstract = {We investigate the effect of the magnetic fields of M dwarf (dM) stars on potentially habitable Earth-like planets. These fields can reduce the size of planetary magnetospheres to such an extent that a significant fraction of the planet’s atmosphere may be exposed to erosion by the stellar wind. We used a sample of 15 active dM stars, for which surface magnetic-field maps were reconstructed, to determine the magnetic pressure at the planet orbit and hence the {\textless}i{\textgreater}largest {\textless}i/{\textgreater}size of its magnetosphere, which would only be decreased by considering the stellar wind. Our method provides a fast means to assess which planets are most affected by the stellar magnetic field, which can be used as a first study to be followed by more sophisticated models. We show that hypothetical Earth-like planets with similar terrestrial magnetisation ({\textasciitilde}1 G) orbiting at the inner (outer) edge of the habitable zone of these stars would present magnetospheres that extend at most up to 6 (11.7) planetary radii. To be able to sustain an Earth-sized magnetosphere, with the exception of only a few cases, the terrestrial planet would either (1) need to orbit significantly farther out than the traditional limits of the habitable zone; or else, (2) if it were orbiting within the habitable zone, it would require at least a magnetic field ranging from a few G to up to a few thousand G. By assuming a magnetospheric size that is more appropriate for the young-Earth (3.4 Gyr ago), the required planetary magnetic fields are one order of magnitude weaker. However, in this case, the polar-cap area of the planet, which is unprotected from transport of particles to/from interplanetary space, is twice as large. At present, we do not know how small the smallest area of the planetary surface is that could be exposed and would still not affect the potential for formation and development of life in a planet. As the star becomes older and, therefore, its rotation rate and magnetic field reduce, the interplanetary magnetic pressure decreases and the magnetosphere of planets probably expands. Using an empirically derived rotation-activity/magnetism relation, we provide an analytical expression for estimating the shortest stellar rotation period for which an Earth-analogue in the habitable zone could sustain an Earth-sized magnetosphere. We find that the required rotation rate of the early- and mid-dM stars (with periods ≳37–202 days) is slower than the solar one, and even slower for the late-dM stars (≳63–263 days). Planets orbiting in the habitable zone of dM stars that rotate faster than this have smaller magnetospheric sizes than that of the Earth magnetosphere. Because many late-dM stars are fast rotators, conditions for terrestrial planets to harbour Earth-sized magnetospheres are more easily achieved for planets orbiting slowly rotating early- and mid-dM stars.},

For the cross-match, we formed clusters of detections that were all linked to the same physical light source on the sky. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: As a first step, onboard detections that were deemed spurious were discarded. The remaining detections were then preliminarily associated with one or more sources in the existing source list in an observation-to-source match. All candidate matches that directly or indirectly were associated with the same source form a match candidate group. The detections from the same group were then subject to a cluster analysis. Each cluster was assigned a source identifier that normally was the same as the identifiers from Gaia DR2. Because the number of individual detections is very high, we also describe the efficient organising of the processing. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We present results and statistics for the final cross-match with particular emphasis on the more complicated cases that are relevant for the users of the Gaia catalogue. We describe the improvements over the earlier Gaia data releases, in particular for stars of high proper motion, for the brightest sources, for variable sources, and for close source pairs.},

AU Mic is a young planetary system with a debris disk and two transiting warm Neptunes. A TTV on the order of several minutes was previously reported for AU Mic b, which was suggested to be an outcome of mutual perturbations between the planets in the system. In 2021, we observed AU Mic b (five transits) and c (three transits) with the CHEOPS space telescope to follow-up the TTV of AU Mic b and possibly detect a TTV for AU Mic c. When analyzing TESS and CHEOPS 2020−2021 measurements together, we find that a prominent TTV emerges with a full span of ≥23 min between the two TTV extrema. Assuming that the period change results from a periodic process -such as mutual perturbations- we demonstrate that the times of transits in the summer of 2022 are expected to be 30−85 min later than predicted by the available linear ephemeris. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The CHEOPS data are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/659/L7"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/659/L7{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The multiplicity fraction of stars, down to the substellar regime, is a parameter of fundamental importance for stellar formation, evolution, and planetology. The census of multiple stars in the solar neighborhood is however incomplete. Our study is aimed at detecting companions of Hipparcos catalog stars from the proper motion anomaly (PMa) they induce on their host star, namely, the difference between their long-term Hipparcos-Gaia and short-term Gaia proper motion vectors. We also aim to detect resolved, gravitationally bound companions of the Hipparcos stars (117,955 stars) and of the Gaia EDR3 stars closer than 100 pc (542,232 stars). In order to identify gravitationally bound visual companions of our sample, we searched the EDR3 catalog for common proper-motion (CPM) candidates. The detection of tangential velocity anomalies with a median accuracy of 26 cm/s per parsec of distance is demonstrated. This improvement by a factor 2.5 in accuracy, as compared to DR2, results in PMa detection limits on companions that are well into the planetary mass regime for many targets. We identify 37,515 Hipparcos stars with a significant PMa (S/N{\textgreater}3), namely, a fraction of 32\% and 12,914 (11\%) hosting CPM bound candidate companions. After including the EDR3 renormalised unit weight error (RUWE{\textgreater}1.4) as an additional indicator, 50,720 stars of the Hipparcos catalog (43\%) exhibit at least one signal of binarity. Among the EDR3 stars within 100 pc, we find CPM bound candidate companions for 39,490 stars (7.3\%). The search for companions using a combination of the PMa, CPM, and RUWE indicators improves the exhaustivity of the multiplicity survey. The detection of CPM companions of very bright stars (heavily saturated on the Gaia detectors) that are classical benchmark objects for stellar physics provides a useful proxy for estimating their distance with a higher accuracy than with Hipparcos.},

Such regions can evolve to polar spots that live more than a year. Adopting the observed weak latitudinal shear and the radius of the active subgiant component of HR 1099, we find longer BMR lifetimes as compared to the more strongly sheared AB Dor case. Random emergence of six additional tilted bipoles in an activity belt at latitude enhanced the lifetimes of polar caps up to 7 years. We have also compared the evolution and lifetime of monolithic starspots with those of conglomerates of smaller spots of similar total area. We find similar decay patterns and lifetimes for both configurations.},

	abstract = {The coeval stars of young open clusters provide insights into the formation of the rotation-activity relationship that elude studies of multi-age field populations. We measure the chromospheric activity of cool stars in the 300 Myr old open cluster NGC 3532 in concert with their rotation periods to study the mass-dependent morphology of activity for this transitional coeval population. Using multi-object spectra of the Ca ii infrared triplet region obtained with the AAOmega spectrograph at the Anglo- Australian Telescope, we measure the chromospheric emission ratios for 454 FGKM cluster members of NGC 3532. The morphology of activity against colour appears to be a near-mirror image of the cluster's rotational behaviour. In particular, we identify a group of 'desaturated transitional rotators' that branches off from the main group of unsaturated FGK slow rotators, and from which it is separated by an 'activity gap'. The few desaturated gap stars are identical to the ones in the rotational gap. Nevertheless, the rotation-activity diagram is completely normal. In fact, the relationship is so tight that it allows us to predict rotation periods for many additional stars. We then precisely determine these periods from our photometric light curves. Our activity measurements show that all fast rotators of near-solar mass have evolved to become slow rotators, demonstrating that the absence of fast rotators in a colour-period diagram is not a detection issue but an astrophysical fact. We also identify a new population of low-activity stars among the early M dwarfs, enabling us to populate the extended slow rotator sequence in the colour-period diagram. The joint analysis of chromospheric activity and photometric time series data thus enables comprehensive insights into the evolution of the rotation and activity of stars during the transitional phase between the Pleiades and Hyades age.

By analyzing small intensity variations in the transit light curves, it was possible to detect and characterize spots on the surface of the star. The model used simulates planetary transits and enables the inclusion of spots on the stellar surface with different sizes, intensities (i.e., temperatures), and positions. Fitting the data with this model, it is possible to infer the physical characteristics of the spots. Because what is observed is the stellar flux blocked by the spots, there is a degeneracy between the spot intensity and area, although the spot radius defines the shape and width of the signal in the light curve. The model allows up to 9 spots to be present on the stellar surface within the transit band. {\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}Before the modeling of the spots was performed, the planetary radius relative to the star radius was estimated by fitting the deepest transit to minimize the effect of spots.

	abstract = {Context: Observations of auroral emissions are powerful means to remotely sense the space plasma environment around planetary bodies and ultracool dwarfs. Therefore successful searches and characterization of aurorae outside the Solar System will open new avenues in the area of extrasolar space physics. Aims: We aim to demonstrate that brown dwarfs are ideal objects to search for UV aurora outside the Solar System. We specifically search for UV aurora on the late-type T6.5 brown dwarf 2MASS J12373919+6526148 (in the following 2MASS J1237+6526). Methods: Introducing a parameter referred to as auroral power potential, we derive scaling models for auroral powers for rotationally driven aurora applicable to a broad range of wavelengths. We also analyze Hubble Space Telescope observations obtained with the STIS camera at near-UV, far-UV, and Ly-\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ wavelengths of 2MASS J1237+6526. Results: We show that brown dwarfs, due to their typically strong surface magnetic fields and fast rotation, can produce auroral UV powers on the order of 10\${\textasciicircum}\{19\}\$ watt or more. Considering their negligible thermal UV emission, their potentially powerful auroral emissions make brown dwarfs ideal candidates for detecting extrasolar aurorae. We find possible emission from 2MASS J1237+6526, but cannot conclusively attribute it to the brown dwarf due to low signal-to-noise values in combination with nonsystematic trends in the background fluxes. The observations provide upper limits for the emission at various UV wavelength bands. The upper limits for the emission correspond to a UV luminosity of \${\textbackslash}sim\$1 \${\textbackslash}times\$ 10\${\textasciicircum}\{19\}\$ watt, which lies in the range of the theoretically expected values. Conclusions: The possible auroral emission from the dwarf could be produced by a close-in companion and/or magnetospheric transport processes.},

By analysing their Lomb-Scargle periodograms, we compute the ratio between the heights of the second and first harmonics of the rotation period (peak-height ratio).{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We find that the peak-height ratios are essentially a function of a single parameter, the fraction of time the spot is visible, which is related to the sinusoidality of the spot modulation. We identify the conditions under which the periodogram analysis can actually provide an estimate of the spot latitudes and/or the stellar inclination angle. We also identify possible sources of error in the identification of the sign of the differential rotation.},

	abstract = {{\textless}i{\textgreater}Context{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. During the solar magnetic activity cycle the emergence latitudes of sunspots change, leading to the well-known butterfly diagram. This phenomenon is poorly understood for other stars since starspot latitudes are generally unknown. The related changes in starspot rotation rates caused by latitudinal differential rotation can, however, be measured.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. Using the set of 3093 {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler{\textless}i/{\textgreater} stars with measured activity cycles, we aim to study the temporal change in starspot rotation rates over magnetic activity cycles, and how this relates to the activity level, the mean rotation rate of the star, and its effective temperature.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We measured the photometric variability as a proxy for the magnetic activity and the spot rotation rate in each quarter over the duration of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler{\textless}i/{\textgreater} mission. We phase-folded these measurements with the cycle period. To reduce random errors, we performed averages over stars with comparable mean rotation rates and effective temperature at fixed activity-cycle phases.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. We detect a clear correlation between the variation of activity level and the variation of the starspot rotation rate. The sign and amplitude of this correlation depends on the mean stellar rotation and – to a lesser extent – on the effective temperature. For slowly rotating stars (rotation periods between 15 − 28 days), the starspot rotation rates are clearly anti-correlated with the level of activity during the activity cycles. A transition is observed around rotation periods of 10 − 15 days, where stars with an effective temperature above 4200 K instead show positive correlation.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions{\textless}i/{\textgreater}. Our measurements can be interpreted in terms of a stellar “butterfly diagram”, but these appear different from that of the Sun since the starspot rotation rates are either in phase or anti-phase with the activity level. Alternatively, the activity cycle periods observed by {\textless}i{\textgreater}Kepler{\textless}i/{\textgreater} are short (around 2.5 years) and may therefore be secondary cycles, perhaps analogous to the solar quasi-biennial oscillations.},

We employed SteParSyn, a Bayesian spectral synthesis implementation particularly designed to infer the stellar atmospheric parameters of late-type stars following a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We made use of the BT-Settl model atmospheres and the radiative transfer code turbospectrum to compute a grid of synthetic spectra around 75 magnetically insensitive Fe I and Ti I lines plus the TiO \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ bands. To avoid any potential degeneracy in the parameter space, we imposed Bayesian priors on Teff and log g based on the comprehensive, multi-band photometric data available for the sample. We find that this methodology is suitable down to M7.0 V, where refractory metals such as Ti are expected to condense in the stellar photospheres. The derived \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$, \${\textbackslash}log\{g\}\$, and [Fe/H] range from 3000 to 4200 K, 4.5 to 5.3 dex, and -0.7 to 0.2 dex, respectively. Although our \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ scale is in good agreement with the literature, we report large discrepancies in the [Fe/H] scales, which might arise from the different methodologies and sets of lines considered. However, our [Fe/H] is in agreement with the metallicity distribution of FGK-type stars in the solar neighbourhood and correlates well with the kinematic membership of the targets in the Galactic populations. Lastly, excellent agreement in \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ is found for M dwarfs with interferometric angular diameter measurements, as well as in the [Fe/H] between the components in the wide physical FGK+M and M+M systems included in our sample.},

	abstract = {The size distribution of sunspots provides key information about the generation and emergence processes of the solar magnetic field. Previous studies of size distribution have primarily focused on either the whole group or individual spot areas. In this paper we investigate the organisation of spot areas within sunspot groups. In particular, we analysed the ratio ({\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater}) of the area of the biggest spot ({\textless}i{\textgreater}A{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}big\_spot{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}) inside a group, to the total area of that group ({\textless}i{\textgreater}A{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}group{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}). We used sunspot observations from Kislovodsk, Pulkovo, and Debrecen observatories, together covering solar cycles 17–24. We find that at the time when the group area reaches its maximum, the single biggest spot in a group typically occupies about 60\% of the group area. For half of all groups, {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} lies in the range between roughly 50\% and 70\%. We also find {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} to change with {\textless}i{\textgreater}A{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}group{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, such that {\textless}i{\textgreater}R{\textless}i/{\textgreater} reaches a maximum of about 0.65 for groups with {\textless}i{\textgreater}A{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}group{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} ≈ 200 μHem and then remains at about 0.6 for larger groups. Our findings imply a scale-invariant emergence pattern, providing an observational constraint on the emergence process. Furthermore, extrapolation of our results to larger sunspot groups may have a bearing on the giant unresolved starspot features found in Doppler images of highly active Sun-like stars. Our results suggest that such giant features are composed of multiple spots, with the largest spot occupying roughly 55–75\% of the total group area (i.e., the area of the giant starspots seen in Doppler images).},

It is only recently that new mid-IR flare observations have begun opening a new window into the response and evolution of the solar chromosphere. These new observations have been mostly performed by the AR30T and BR30T telescopes that are operating in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. We present the analysis of SOL2019-05-15T19:24, a GOES class C2.0 solar flare observed at 30{\textasciitilde}THz (10\${\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mu\$m) by the ground-based telescope AR30T. Our aim is to characterize the evolution of the flaring atmosphere and the energy transport mechanism in the context of mid-IR emission. We performed a multi-wavelength analysis of the event by complementing the mid-IR data with diverse ground- and space-based data from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), the H--\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ Solar Telescope for Argentina (HASTA), and the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA). Our study includes the analysis of the magnetic field evolution of the flaring region and of the development of the flare. The mid-IR images from AR30T show two bright and compact flare sources that are spatially associated with the flare kernels observed in ultraviolet (UV) by SDO. We confirm that the temporal association between mid-IR and UV fluxes previously reported for strong flares is also observed for this small flare. The EOVSA microwave data revealed flare spectra consistent with thermal free-free emission, which lead us to dismiss the existence of a significant number of non-thermal electrons. We thus consider thermal conduction as the primary mechanism responsible for energy transport. Our estimates for the thermal conduction energy and total radiated energy fall within the same order of magnitude, reinforcing our conclusions.},

Such a quadrupole is due to the magnetic flux tubes in the stellar convection zone, unevenly distributed in longitude and persisting for many stellar rotations as observed in young late-type stars.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} The rotation period of the host star evolves from its shortest value on the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) to longer periods due to the loss of angular momentum through a magnetized wind. If the stellar rotation period comes close to twice the orbital period of the planet, the quadrupole leads to a spin-orbit resonance that excites oscillations of the star-planet separation. As a consequence, a strong tidal dissipation is produced inside the planet that converts the energy of the oscillations into internal heat. The total heat released inside the planet scales as {\textless}i{\textgreater}a{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}−8{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, where {\textless}i{\textgreater}a{\textless}i/{\textgreater} is the orbit semimajor axis, and it is largely independent of the details of the planetary internal dissipation or the lifetime of the stellar magnetic flux tubes.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We illustrate the operation of the mechanism by modeling the evolution of the stellar rotation and of the innermost planetary orbit under the action of the stellar wind and the tides in the cases of CoRoT-7, Kepler-78, and K2-141 whose present orbital periods range between 0.28 and 0.85 days. If the spin-orbit resonance occurs, the maximum power dissipated inside the planets ranges between 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}19{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} W, while the total dissipated energy is on the order of 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}30{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}−10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}32{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} J over a time interval as short as (1−4.5) × 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}4{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} yr.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our illustrative models suggest that, if their host stars started their evolution on the ZAMS as fast rotators with periods between 0.5 and 1.0 days, the resonance occurred after about 40 Myr since the host stars settled on the ZAMS in all the three cases. This huge heating over such a short time interval produces a complete melting of the planetary interiors and may shut off their hydromagnetic dynamos. These may initiate a successive phase of intense internal heating owing to unipolar magnetic star-planet interactions and affect the composition and the escape of their atmospheres, producing effects that could be observable during the entire lifetime of the planets.},

	abstract = {Context. Open clusters are known as excellent tools for various topics in Galactic research. For example, they allow accurately tracing the chemical structure of the Galactic disc. However, the metallicity is known only for a rather low percentage of the open cluster population, and these values are based on a variety of methods and data. Therefore, a large and homogeneous sample is highly desirable. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: In the third part of our series we compile a large sample of homogenised open cluster metallicities using a wide variety of different sources. These data and a sample of Cepheids are used to investigate the radial metallicity gradient, age effects, and to test current models. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used photometric and spectroscopic data to derive cluster metallicities. The different sources were checked and tested for possible offsets and correlations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: In total, metallicities for 172 open cluster were derived. We used the spectroscopic data of 100 objects for a study of the radial metallicity distribution and the age-metallicity relation. We found a possible increase of metallicity with age, which, if confirmed, would provide observational evidence for radial migration. Although a statistical significance is given, more studies are certainly needed to exclude selection effects, for example. The comparison of open clusters and Cepheids with recent Galactic models agrees well in general. However, the models do not reproduce the flat gradient of the open clusters in the outer disc. Thus, the effect of radial migration is either underestimated in the models, or an additional mechanism is at work. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Apart from the Cepheids, open clusters are the best tracers for metallicity over large Galactocentric distances in the Milky Way. For a sound statistical analysis, a sufficiently large and homogeneous sample of cluster metallicities is needed. Our compilation is currently by far the largest and provides the basis for several basic studies such as the statistical treatment of the Galactic cluster population, or evolutionary studies of individual star groups in open clusters.},

Radial differential rotation is an important parameter for stellar dynamo theory and for understanding angular momentum transport. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We investigate the potential of using a large number of similar stars simultaneously to constrain their average radial differential rotation gradient: we call this "ensemble fitting". {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We use a range of stellar models along the main sequence, each with a synthetic rotation profile. The rotation profiles are step functions with a step of ΔΩ = -0.35 μHz, which is located at the base of the convection zone. These models are used to compute the rotational splittings of the p modes and to model their uncertainties. We then fit an ensemble of stars to infer the average ΔΩ. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: All the uncertainties on the inferred ΔΩ for individual stars are of the order 1 μHz. Using 15 stellar models in an ensemble fit, we show that the uncertainty on the average ΔΩ is reduced to less than the input ΔΩ, which allows us to constrain the sign of the radial differential rotation. We show that a solar-like ΔΩ ≈ 30 nHz can be constrained by an ensemble fit of thousands of main-sequence stars. Observing the number of stars required to successfully exploit the ensemble fitting method will be possible with future asteroseismology missions, such as PLATO. We demonstrate the potential of ensemble fitting by showing that any systematic differences in the average ΔΩ between F, G, and K-type stars larger than 100 nHz could be detected.},

	abstract = {A few studies have reported a significant dearth of exoplanets with Neptune mass and radius with orbital periods below 2-4 d. This cannot be explained by observational biases because many Neptunian planets with longer orbital periods have been detected. The existence of this desert is similar to the appearance of the so-called brown-dwarf desert that suggests different formation mechanisms of planets and stellar companions with short orbital periods. Similarly, the Neptunian desert might indicate different mechanisms of formation and evolution for hot Jupiters and short-period super-Earths. We here follow a previous study and examine the location and shape of the desert in both the period-mass and period-radius planes, using the currently available large samples of planets. The desert in the period-mass plane has a relatively sharp upper edge, with a planetary mass that is inversely proportional to the planetary orbital period, while the lower, somewhat blurred, boundary is located along masses that are apparently linearly proportional to the period. The desert in the period-radius plane of the transiting planets is less clear. It seems as if the radius along the upper boundary is inversely proportional to the period to the power of one-third, while the lower boundary shows a radius that is proportional to the period to the power of two-thirds. The combination of the two upper bounds of the desert, in the period-mass and period-radius planes, yields a planetary mass-radius relation of R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≃ (1.2 ± 0.3)(M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}){\textless}SUP{\textgreater}0.27 ± 0.11{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for 0.1 ≲ M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≲ 1.

Observations of open clusters have revealed a bimodal distribution of the rotation periods of solar-like stars that has proven difficult to explain under the existing rubric of magnetic braking. Recent studies suggest that magnetic complexity can play an important role in controlling stellar spin-down rates. However, magnetic morphology is still neglected in most rotation evolution models due to the difficulty of properly accounting for its effects on wind driving and angular momentum loss. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Using state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamical magnetized wind simulations we study the effect that different distributions of the magnetic flux at different levels of geometrical complexity have on mass and angular momentum loss rates. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Angular momentum loss rates depend strongly on the level of complexity of the field but are independent of the way this complexity is distributed. We deduce the analytical terms representing the magnetic field morphology dependence of mass and angular momentum loss rates. We also define a parameter that best represents complexity for real stars. As a test, we use these analytical methods to estimate mass and angular momentum loss rates for 8 stars with observed magnetograms and compare them to the simulated results. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Magnetic field complexity provides a natural physical basis for stellar rotation evolution models requiring a rapid transition between weak and strong spin-down modes.},

	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: There are two goals in this study. One is to investigate how frequently white-light flares (WLFs) occur in a flare-productive active region (NOAA active region 11515). The other is to investigate the relationship between WLFs and magnetic transients (MTs). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used the high-cadence (45 s) full-disk continuum filtergrams and line-of-sight magnetograms taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to identify WLFs and MTs, respectively. Images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO were also used to show the flare morphology in the upper atmosphere. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We found at least 20 WLFs out of a total of 70 flares above C class (28.6\%) in NOAA active region 11515 during its passage across the solar disk (E45°-W45°). Each of these WLFs occurred in a small region, with a short duration of about 5 min. The enhancement of the white-light continuum intensity is usually small, with an average enhancement of 8.1\%. The 20 WLFs we observed were found along an unusual configuration of the magnetic field that was characterized by a narrow ribbon of negative field. Furthermore, the WLFs were found to be accompanied by MTs, with radical changes in magnetic field strength (or even a sign reversal) observed during the flare. In contrast, there is no obvious signature of MTs in the 50 flares without white-light enhancements. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our results suggest that WLFs occur much more frequently than previously thought, with most WLFs being fairly weak enhancements. This may explain why WLFs are reported rarely. Our observations also suggest that MTs and WLFs are closely related and appear cospatial and cotemporal, when considering HMI data. A greater enhancement of WL emission is often accompanied by a greater change in the line-of-sight component of the unsigned magnetic field. Considering the close relationship between MTs and WLFs, many previously reported flares with MTs may be WLFs. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The movie is available at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

While rotation periods of active stars can be reliably determined, the light curves of many older and less active stars, such as stars that are similar to the Sun, are quite irregular. This hampers the determination of their rotation periods. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to examine the factors causing these irregularities in stellar brightness variations and to develop a method for determining rotation periods for low-activity stars with irregular light curves. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We extended the Spectral And Total Irradiance Reconstruction approach for modeling solar brightness variations to Sun-like stars. We calculated the power spectra of stellar brightness variations for various combinations of parameters that define the surface configuration and evolution of stellar magnetic features. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The short lifetime of spots in comparison to the stellar rotation period, as well as the interplay between spot and facular contributions to brightness variations of stars with near solar activity, cause irregularities in their light curves. The power spectra of such stars often lack a peak associated with the rotation period. Nevertheless, the rotation period can still be determined by measuring the period where the concavity of the power spectrum plotted in the log-log scale changes its sign, that is, by identifying the position of the inflection point. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The inflection point of the (log-log) power spectrum is found to be a new diagnostic for stellar rotation periods which is shown to work even in cases where the power spectrum shows no peak at the rotation rate.},

	abstract = {Context. Rotation period measurements of stars observed with the Kepler mission have revealed a lack of stars at intermediate rotation periods, accompanied by a decrease of photometric variability. Whether this so-called dearth region is a peculiarity of stars in the Kepler field, or reflects a general manifestation of stellar magnetic activity, is still under debate. The K2 mission has the potential to unravel this mystery by measuring stellar rotation and photometric variability along different fields in the sky. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Our goal is to measure stellar rotation periods and photometric variabilities for tens of thousands of K2 stars, located in different fields along the ecliptic plane, to shed light on the relation between stellar rotation and photometric variability. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We use Lomb-Scargle periodograms, auto-correlation and wavelet functions to determine consistent rotation periods. Stellar brightness variability is assessed by computing the variability range, R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}var{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, from the light curve. We further apply Gaussian mixture models to search for bimodality in the rotation period distribution. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Combining measurements from all K2 campaigns, we detect rotation periods in 29 860 stars. The reliability of these periods was estimated from stars observed more than once. We find that 75-90\% of the stars show period deviation smaller than 20\% between different campaigns, depending on the peak height threshold in the periodograms. For effective temperatures below 6000 K, the variability range shows a local minimum at different periods, consistent with an isochrone age of ∼750 Myr. Additionally, the rotation period distribution shows evidence for bimodality, although the dearth region in the K2 data is less pronounced compared to the Kepler field. The period at the dip of the bimodal distribution shows good agreement with the period at the local variability minimum. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We conclude that the rotation period bimodality is present in different fields of the sky, and is hence a general manifestation of stellar magnetic activity. The reduced variability in the dearth region is interpreted as a cancelation between dark spots and bright faculae. Our results strongly advocate that the role of faculae has been underestimated so far, suggesting a more complex dependence of the brightness variability on the rotation period. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Table 2 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/635/A43"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/635/A43{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context. The study of young solar-type stars is fundamental for better understanding the magnetic activity of the Sun. Most commonly, this activity manifests itself in the form of spots and faculae. As a planet in transit crosses in front of its host star, a dark spot on the stellar surface may be occulted, causing a detectable variation in the light curve. Kepler-63 is a young solar-like star with an age of only 210 Myr that exhibits photometric variations compatible with spot signatures. Because the planet that orbits it is in an almost polar orbit, different latitudes of the star can be probed by the method of spot transit mapping. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The goal of this work is to characterise the spots of Kepler-63 and thus decipher the behaviour of the young Sun. Because planetary orbit is highly oblique, the latitudinal distribution and thus the differential rotation of the spots may be determined. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: A total of 150 transits of Kepler-63b were observed in the short-cadence light curve, corresponding to a total duration of about four years. Each transit light curve was fit by a model that simulates planetary transits and allows including starspots on the surface of the host star. This enables the physical characterisation of the spot size, intensity, and location. We determined the spot position in a reference frame that rotates with the star, and thus obtained the latitudinal distribution of the spots. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We fit a total of 297 spots and determined their sizes, intensities, and positions. The longitude and latitude of the spots were calculated in a reference frame that rotated with the star. The latitude distribution of spots exhibits a bimodality with a lack of spots around 34°. Moreover, the spot sizes tend to be larger close to the equator, but decrease toward the latitude distribution gap, after which they again increase toward the poles. High-latitude spots dominate the magnetic cycle of Kepler-63. For a mean stellar rotation period of 5.400 d, 59 spots were found at approximately the same longitude and latitude on a later transit. Some of these spots were detected eight transits later. This shows that the lifetimes of spots can be at least 75 d. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The geometry of the Kepler-63 system, enabled us to build a starspot butterfly diagram, similar to that of sunspots. It was also possible to infer the differential rotation of Kepler-63 from the spots at different latitudes. This star was found to rotate almost rigidly with a period of 5.400 d and a relative shear close to 0.01\% for latitudes lower than 34°, whereas the high latitudes do not follow a well-behaved pattern.},

We select both field and cluster (open and globular) stars, compare the observations with previous classifications and with stellar evolutionary tracks, and we present variations of the Gaia HRD with age, metallicity, and kinematics. Late stages of stellar evolution such as hot subdwarfs, post-AGB stars, planetary nebulae, and white dwarfs are also analysed, as well as low-mass brown dwarf objects. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The Gaia HRDs are unprecedented in both precision and coverage of the various Milky Way stellar populations and stellar evolutionary phases.

The second Gaia data release contains precise astrometry at the submilliarcsecond level and homogeneous photometry at the mmag level, that can be used to characterise a large number of clusters over the entire sky. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: In this study we aim to establish a list of members and derive mean parameters, in particular distances, for as many clusters as possible, making use of Gaia data alone. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We compiled a list of thousands of known or putative clusters from the literature. We then applied an unsupervised membership assignment code, UPMASK, to the Gaia DR2 data contained within the fields of those clusters. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We obtained a list of members and cluster parameters for 1229 clusters. As expected, the youngest clusters are seen to be tightly distributed near the Galactic plane and to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way, while older objects are more uniformly distributed, deviate further from the plane, and tend to be located at larger Galactocentric distances. Thanks to the quality of Gaia DR2 astrometry, the fully homogeneous parameters derived in this study are the most precise to date. Furthermore, we report on the serendipitous discovery of 60 new open clusters in the fields analysed during this study. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Table 1 is only available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/618/A93"{\textgreater}http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/618/A93{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Complexity Theory is highly interdisciplinary, therefore any regularities must hold on all levels of organization, independent on the nature of the system. An open question in science is how complex systems self-organize to produce emergent structures and properties, a branch of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. It has long been known that there is a quantity-quality transition in natural systems. This is to say that the properties of a system depend on its size. More recently, this has been termed the size-complexity rule, which means that to increase their size, systems must increase their complexity, and that to increase their complexity they must grow in size. This rule goes under different names in different disciplines and systems of different nature, such as the area-speciation rule, economies of scale, scaling relations (allometric) in biology and for cities, and many others. We apply the size-complexity rule to stars to compare them with other complex systems in order to find universal patterns of self-organization independent of the substrate. Here, as a measure of complexity of a star, we are using the degree of grouping of nucleons into atoms, which reduces nucleon entropy, increases the variety of elements, and changes the structure of the star. As seen in our previous work, complexity, using action efficiency, is in power law proportionality of all other characteristics of a complex system, including its size. Here we find that, as for the other systems studied, the complexity of stars is in a power law proportionality with their size - the bigger a system is, the higher its level of complexity is - despite differing explosion energies and initial metallicities from simulations and data, which confirms the size-complexity rule and our model.},

Now the primary flare products, high-energy electrons and ions, can be spatially resolved in hard X-rays (HXRs) and gamma rays on the Sun. Soft X-rays (SXRs) are observed from most stars, including young stellar objects. Structure and bulk motions of the corona are imaged on the Sun in high temperature lines and are inferred from line shifts in stellar coronae. Magnetic reconnection is the trigger for reorganization of the magnetic field into a lower energy configuration. A large fraction of the energy is converted into nonthermal particles that transport the energy to higher density gas, heating it to SXR-emitting temperatures. Flares on young stars are several orders of magnitude more luminous and more frequent; they significantly ionize protoplanetary disks and planetary ionospheres.},

In the present paper we explain the behaviour in flight, based on raw and corrected data. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: Five runs have been completed since January 2007. The data used here are essentially those acquired during the commissioning phase and from a long run that lasted 146 days. These enable us to give a complete overview of the instrument and platform behaviour for all environmental conditions. The ground based data processing is not described in detail because the most important method has been published elsewhere. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: We show that the performance specifications are easily satisfied when the environmental conditions are favourable. Most of the perturbations, hence data corrections, are related to LEO perturbations: high energy particles inside the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), eclipses and temperature variations, and line of sight fluctuations due to the attitude control system. Straylight due to the reflected light from the earth, which is controlled by the telescope and baffle design, appears to be negligible. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The CoRoT space mission, launched on December 27th 2006, has been developed and is operated by CNES, with contributions from Austria, Belgium, Brazil, ESA, Germany and Spain. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Four French laboratories associated with the CNRS (LESIA, LAM, IAS, OMP) collaborate with CNES on the satellite development.

	abstract = {Context. Stellar rotation periods can be determined by observing brightness variations caused by active magnetic regions transiting visible stellar disk as the star rotates. Successful stellar photometric surveys stemming from the Kepler and TESS observations have led to the determination of rotation periods in tens of thousands of young and active stars. However, there is still a lack of information on the rotation periods of older and less active stars like the Sun. The irregular temporal profiles of light curves caused by the decay times of active regions, which are comparable to, or even shorter than, stellar rotation periods, in combination with the random emergence of active regions make period determination for such stars very difficult. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We tested the performance of a new method for the determination of stellar rotation periods against stars with previously determined rotation periods. The method is based on calculating the gradient of the power spectrum (GPS) and identifying the position of the inflection point (i.e. point with the highest gradient). The GPS method is specifically aimed at determining rotation periods of low-activity stars like the Sun. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We applied the GPS method to 1047 Sun-like stars observed by the Kepler telescope. We considered two stellar samples individually: one with near-solar rotation periods (24-27.4 d) and a broad range of effective temperatures (5000-6000 K) and the other with near-solar effective temperatures (5700-5900 K) and a broad range of rotation periods (15-40 d). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We show that the GPS method returns precise values for stellar rotation periods. Furthermore, it allows us to constrain the ratio between facular and spot areas of active regions at the moment of their emergence. We also show that the relative facular area decreases with the stellar rotation rate. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our results suggest that the GPS method can be successfully applied to retrieve the periods of stars with both regular and non-regular light curves. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Table 2 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/642/A225"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/642/A225{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {We review magnetic-field measurements of nondegenerate stars across the Hertzprung-Russell diagram for main sequence, premain sequence, and postmain sequence stars. For stars with complex magnetic-field morphologies, which includes all G-M main sequence stars, the analysis of spectra obtained in polarized vs unpolarized light provides very different magnetic measurements because of the presence or absence of cancellation by oppositely directed magnetic fields within the instrument's spatial resolution. This cancellation can be severe, as indicated by the spatially averaged magnetic field of the Sun viewed as a star. These averaged fields are smaller by a factor of 1000 or more compared to spatially resolved magnetic-field strengths. We explain magnetic-field terms that characterize the fields obtained with different measurement techniques. Magnetic fields typically control the structure of stellar atmospheres in and above the photosphere, the heating rates of stellar chromospheres and coronae, mass and angular momentum loss through stellar winds, chemical peculiarity, and the emission of high energy photons, which is critically important for the evolution of protoplanetary disks and the habitability of exoplanets. Since these effects are governed by the star's magnetic energy, which is proportional to the magnetic-field strength squared and its fractional surface coverage, it is important to measure or reliably infer the true magnetic-field strength and filling factor across a stellar disk. We summarize magnetic-field measurements obtained with the different observing techniques for different types of stars and estimate the highest magnetic-field strengths. We also comment on the different field morphologies observed for stars across the H-R diagram, typically inferred from Zeeman-Doppler imaging and rotational modulation observations,},

Additionally, both stars have complex, and evolving, large-scale surface magnetic fields with a significant toroidal component. High levels of surface differential rotation were measured for both stars. For the F8V star HD 35296 a rotational shear of ΔΩ = 0.22{\textasciicircum}\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.02\} rad d- 1 was derived from the observed magnetic profiles. For the G3V star HD 29615, the magnetic features indicate a rotational shear of ΔΩ = 0.48\_\{-0.12\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.11\} rad d- 1, while the spot features, with a distinctive polar spot, provide a much lower value of ΔΩ of 0.07\_\{-0.03\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.10\} rad d- 1. Such a significant discrepancy in shear values between spot and magnetic features for HD 29615 is an extreme example of the variation observed for other lower mass stars. From the extensive and persistent azimuthal field observed for both targets, it is concluded that a distributed dynamo operates in these moderately rotating Sun-like stars, in marked contrast to the Sun's interface-layer dynamo.},

	abstract = {Shallow submerged lines of force of an initial axisymmetric dipolar field of 8 X 1021 maxwells are drawn out in longitude by the differential rotation (after the suggestion of Cowling) to produce a spiral wrapping of five turns in the north and south hemispheres after 3 years. The amplification factor approaches 45, with a marked dependence on latitude. Twisting of the irregular flux strands by the faster shallow layers in low latitudes forms "ropes" with local concentrations that are brought to the surface by magnetic buoyancy to produce bipolar magnetic regions (BMR's) with associated sunspots and related activity. The field intensity required for producing BMR's is reached at progressively lower latitudes according to the derived formula sin = + 1.5/(n + 3), where n is the number of years since the beginning of the sunspot cycle. This accounts satisfactorily for 's law and the Maunder "butterfly diagram." Sufficient flux rope for more than 102 BMR's is produced. "Preceding" parts of BMR's expand toward the equator as they age, to be neutralized by merging; "following" parts expand or migrate poleward so that their lines of force neutralize and then replace the initial dipolar field. This process, which involves severing and reconnection of lines of force in the corona, as well as expulsion of flux loops, need be only 1 per cent efficient. The result, after sunspot maximum, is a main dipolar field of reversed polarity. The process repeats itself, so that the initial conditions are reproduced after a complete 22-year magnetic cycle. This model accounts for Hale's laws of sunspot polarity and provides a qualitative explanation of the proponderance of "preceding" spots, of the forward tilt of the axes of older spots, of the recurrence of activity in preferred longitudes, and of Hale's chromospheric "whirls."},

Assuming that the observed variability of polarimetric signal is controlled by stellar rotation, we establish the rotation periods of our targets, with values ranging from 8.8 d (for HD 190771) to 22.7 d (for HD 146233). Apart from rotation, fundamental parameters of the selected objects are very close to the Sun's, making this sample a practical basis to investigate the specific impact of rotation on magnetic properties of Sun-like stars. We reconstruct the large-scale magnetic geometry of the targets as a low-order (l {\textless} 10) spherical harmonic expansion of the surface magnetic field. From the set of magnetic maps, we draw two main conclusions. (i) The magnetic energy of the large-scale field increases with rotation rate. The increase in chromospheric emission with the mean magnetic field is flatter than observed in the Sun. Since the chromospheric flux is also sensitive to magnetic elements smaller than those contributing to the polarimetric signal, this observation suggests that a larger fraction of the surface magnetic energy is stored in large scales as rotation increases. (ii) Whereas the magnetic field is mostly poloidal for low rotation rates, more rapid rotators host a large-scale toroidal component in their surface field. From our observations, we infer that a rotation period lower than {\textasciitilde}12 d is necessary for the toroidal magnetic energy to dominate over the poloidal component.},

Important changes in the dynamos operating in these stars may result from this evolution, which should be observable in their surface magnetic fields. Here we present a study aimed at observing the evolution of these magnetic fields through this critical time period. We observed stars in open clusters and stellar associations of known ages, and used Zeeman Doppler imaging to characterize their complex magnetic large-scale fields. Presented here are results for 15 stars, from five associations, with ages from 20 to 250 Myr, masses from 0.7 to 1.2 M⊙, and rotation periods from 0.4 to 6 d. We find complex large-scale magnetic field geometries, with global average strengths from 14 to 140 G. There is a clear trend towards decreasing average large-scale magnetic field strength with age, and a tight correlation between magnetic field strength and Rossby number. Comparing the magnetic properties of our zero-age main-sequence sample to those of both younger and older stars, it appears that the magnetic evolution of solar-type stars during the pre-main sequence is primarily driven by structural changes, while it closely follows the stars' rotational evolution on the main sequence.},

	abstract = {More than 450 magnetograms, showing the distribution, intensity, and polarity of weak magnetic fields ({\textgreater} 0.3 gauss) on the sun have been obtained with the solar magnetograph over a two-year period. This interval includes the recent minimum of solar magnetic activity. The records show a pattern with a fluctuating fine structure and certain large-scale regularities. General magnetic fietd.-Consistent evidence is found for a general field, predominantly dipolar, with polarity opposite to that of the earth. The mean intensity is of the order of 1 gauss. The general field is usually limited to heliographic latitudes greater than about t 550; it has a varying fine structure and shows remarkable random fluctuations in effective intensity and extent. There seems to be no prevailing obliquity between the magnetic and rotational axes. The total flux is estimated to be nearly 10 maxwells. Bipolar magnetic (BM) regions.-In the lower latitndes the stronger magnetic effects appear as contiguous areas of opposite magnetic polarity, as if loops of a submerged toroidal field were occasionally brought to the surface by rising material. The BM regions obey Hale's laws of sunspot polarity, but spots are comparatively rare, occurring, when at all, within the BM regions while they are young. Ca ii plages are observed where the field intensity is greater than about 2 gauss. Hydrogen filaments occur around the borders of BM regions or, alternatively, seem to divide the region into parts of opposite polarity. As the regions age, they generally expand, showing a decrease in field intensity, and disintegrate until lost in the background of irregular weak fields. There is much diversity in total magnetic flux, duration, area, and course of development. Unipolar magnetic (UM) regions.-Occasional extended magnetic areas of only one outstanding polarity were recognized. The most prominent UM region of 1953 had an intensity 3 gauss and a duration of many months; it may well have been related to a prominent sequence of 27-day-recurrent terrestrial magnetic storms. UM regions may be remnants of disintegrating BM regions. We suggest that UM regions may be identified as the heretofore hypothetical "M" regions of Bartels. Repeated tracings of the same area of the sun at intervals of a few minutes show changes of the order of 1 gauss in the fine structure of the magnetic pattern within a half-hour. The observations provide objective evidence for the heretofore inferential hypothesis that magnetic fields are fundamental to sunspots, plages, prominences, chromospheric fine structure, bright coronal emissions, and, probably, regions of strong radio emission. Several solar phenomena can be synthesized on the proposition that neutral but ionized corpuscular streams are continually being ejected from all turbulent regions of the surface characterized by coherent magnetic fields of average intensity gauss or more. A hydromagnetic model, based on chromospheric spicules, is proposed for such ejection.},

	abstract = {The central problem in forming a star is the angular momentum in the circumstellar disk, which prevents material from falling into the central stellar core. An attractive solution to the angular momentum problem appears to be the ubiquitous (low-velocity and poorly collimated) molecular outflows and (high-velocity and highly collimated) protostellar jets accompanying the earliest phase of star formation that remove angular momentum at a range of disk radii1. Previous observations have suggested that outflowing material carries away the excess angular momentum via magneto-centrifugally driven winds from the surfaces of circumstellar disks down to ∼10 au scales2,3,4,5,6, allowing the material in the outer disk to be transported to the inner disk. Here we show that highly collimated protostellar jets remove the residual angular momenta at the ∼0.05 au scale, enabling the material in the innermost region of the disk to accrete towards the central protostar. This is supported by the rotation of the jet measured down to ∼10 au from the protostar in the HH 212 protostellar system. The measurement implies a jet launching radius of ∼0.05-0.02+0.05 au on the disk, based on the magneto-centrifugal theory of jet production, which connects the properties of the jet measured at large distances with those at its base through energy and angular momentum conservation7.},

Since this line polarization has been attributed to the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in the presence of magnetic field, our observations show convincingly the presence of magnetic field in a jet from a low-mass protostar.

	abstract = {The driving mechanism of protostellar outflows and jets and their effects on the star formation process obtained from recent theoretical and numerical studies are described. Low-velocity outflows are driven by an outer region of the circumstellar disk, while high-velocity jets are driven near an inner edge of the disk. The disk angular momentum is effectively transferred by magnetic effects in the outflow and jet driving regions where the magnetic field is well coupled with neutral gas. On the other hand, in a high density gas region of the disk (or intermediate region), the magnetic field dissipates and is decoupled from neutral gas. Thus, in such a magnetically inactive region, no outward flow appears and the disk angular momentum is not effectively transferred by magnetic effects. Therefore, in the disk intermediate region, the disk surface density continues to increase and gravitational instability occurs and produce a non-axisymmetric (or spiral) structure. After spiral arms sufficiently develop, the disk angular momentum is transferred by gravitational torque and a large amount of the disk mass accretes onto the central protostar from the circumstellar disk. The episodic accretion induces time-variable high-velocity jets. The jets do not significantly contribute to a dynamical evolution of the protostar and circumstellar disk, while the low-velocity outflows can eject a large fraction of the infalling gas and determine the final stellar mass.},

Protostellar outflows can be observed from radio to X-ray wavelengths in the continuum and a multitude of spectral lines that probe a wide range of physical conditions, chemical phases, radial velocities, and proper motions. Wide-field visual and near-IR data, mid-IR observations from space, and aperture synthesis with centimeter- and millimeterwave interferometers are revolutionizing outflow studies. Many outflows originate in multiple systems and clusters. Although most flows are bipolar and some contain highly collimated jets, others are wide-angle winds, and a few are nearly isotropic and exhibit explosive behavior. Morphologies and velocity fields indicate variations in ejection velocity, mass-loss rate, and in some cases, flow orientation and degree of collimation. These trends indicate that stellar accretion is episodic and often occurs in a complex dynamical environment. Outflow power increases with source luminosity but decreases with evolutionary stage. The youngest outflows are small and best traced by molecules such as CO, SiO, H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}O, and H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}. Older outflows can grow to parsec scales and are best traced by shock-excited atoms and ions such as hydrogen-recombination lines, [Sii], and [Oii]. Outflows inject momentum and energy into their surroundings and provide an important mechanism in the self-regulation of star formation. However, momentum injection rates remain uncertain with estimates providing lower bounds.},

	abstract = {In this review we focus on the role jets and outflows play in the star- and planet-formation process. Our essential question can be posed as follows: Are jets/outflows merely an epiphenomenon associated with star formation, or do they play an important role in mediating the physics of assembling stars both individually and globally? We address this question by reviewing the current state of observations and their key points of contact with theory. Our review of jet/outflow phenomena is organized into three length-scale domains: (1) source and disk scales (0.1-102 AU) where the connection with protostellar and disk evolution theories is paramount; (2) envelope scales (102-105 AU) where the chemistry and propagation shed further light on the jet launching process, its variability and its impact on the infalling envelope; and (3) parent cloud scales (105-106 AU) where global momentum injection into cluster/cloud environments become relevant. Issues of feedback are of particular importance on the smallest scales, where planet formation regions in a disk may be impacted by the presence of disk winds, irradiation by jet shocks, or shielding by the winds. Feedback on envelope scales may determine the final stellar mass (core-to-star efficiency) and envelope dissipation. Feedback also plays an important role on the larger scales with outflows contributing to turbulent support within clusters, including alteration of cluster star-formation efficiencies (SFEs) (feedback on larger scales currently appears unlikely). In describing these observations we also look to the future and consider the questions that new facilities such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Jansky Array can address. A particularly novel dimension of our review is that we consider results on jet dynamics from the emerging field of high-energy-density laboratory astrophysics (HEDLA), which is now providing direct insights into the three-dimesional dynamics of fully magnetized, hypersonic, radiative outflows.},

	abstract = {A major obstacle to interpreting the rotation period distribution for main-sequence stars from Kepler mission data has been the lack of a precise evolutionary status for these objects. We address this by investigating the evolutionary status based on Gaia Data Release 2 parallaxes and photometry for more than 30,000 Kepler stars with rotation period measurements. Many of these are subgiants and should be excluded in future work on dwarfs. We particularly investigate a 193-star sample of solar analogs and report newly determined rotation periods for 125 of these. These include 54 stars from a prior sample, of which we can confirm the periods for 50. The remainder are new, and 10 of them longer than a solar rotation period, suggesting that Sun-like stars continue to spin down on the main sequence past solar age. Our sample of solar analogs could potentially serve as a benchmark for future missions, such as PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars, and emphasizes the need for additional astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic information before interpreting the stellar populations and results from time series surveys.},

	abstract = {It has been known for a decade that hot stars with hot Jupiters tend to have high obliquities. Less is known about the degree of spin-orbit alignment for hot stars with other kinds of planets. Here, we reassess the obliquities of hot Kepler stars with transiting planets smaller than Neptune, based on spectroscopic measurements of their projected rotation velocities ( \$v{\textbackslash}sin i\$ ). The basis of the method is that a lower obliquity—all other things being equal—causes \${\textbackslash}sin i\$ to be closer to unity and increases the value of \$v{\textbackslash}sin i\$ . We sought evidence for this effect using a sample of 150 Kepler stars with effective temperatures between 5950 and 6550 K and a control sample of 101 stars with matching spectroscopic properties and random orientations. The planet hosts have systematically higher values of \$v{\textbackslash}sin i\$ than the control stars, but not by enough to be compatible with perfect spin-orbit alignment. The mean value of \${\textbackslash}sin i\$ is 0.856 ± 0.036, which is 4σ away from unity (perfect alignment), and 2σ away from \${\textbackslash}pi /4\$ (random orientations). There is also evidence that the hottest stars have a broader obliquity distribution: when modeled separately, the stars cooler than 6250 K have \$ {\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}sin i {\textbackslash}rangle =0.928{\textbackslash}pm 0.042\$ while the hotter stars are consistent with random orientations. This is similar to the pattern previously noted for stars with hot Jupiters. Based on these results, obliquity excitation for early-G and late-F stars appears to be a general outcome of star and planet formation, rather than being exclusively linked to hot Jupiter formation. * The data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

	abstract = {We present a series of models for the plasma properties along open magnetic flux tubes rooted in solar coronal holes, streamers, and active regions. These models represent the first self-consistent solutions that combine (1) chromospheric heating driven by an empirically guided acoustic wave spectrum; (2) coronal heating from Alfvén waves that have been partially reflected, then damped by anisotropic turbulent cascade; and (3) solar wind acceleration from gradients of gas pressure, acoustic wave pressure, and Alfvén wave pressure. The only input parameters are the photospheric lower boundary conditions for the waves and the radial dependence of the background magnetic field along the flux tube. We have not included multifluid or collisionless effects (e.g., preferential ion heating), which are not yet fully understood. For a single choice for the photospheric wave properties, our models produce a realistic range of slow and fast solar wind conditions by varying only the coronal magnetic field. Specifically, a two-dimensional model of coronal holes and streamers at solar minimum reproduces the latitudinal bifurcation of slow and fast streams seen by Ulysses. The radial gradient of the Alfvén speed affects where the waves are reflected and damped, and thus whether energy is deposited below or above the Parker critical point. As predicted by earlier studies, a larger coronal ``expansion factor'' gives rise to a slower and denser wind, higher temperature at the coronal base, less intense Alfvén waves at 1 AU, and correlative trends for commonly measured ratios of ion charge states and FIP-sensitive abundances that are in general agreement with observations. These models offer supporting evidence for the idea that coronal heating and solar wind acceleration (in open magnetic flux tubes) can occur as a result of wave dissipation and turbulent cascade.},

	abstract = {We investigate the ionization of hydrogen in a dynamic solar atmosphere. The simulations include a detailed non-LTE treatment of hydrogen, calcium, and helium but lack other important elements. Furthermore, the omission of magnetic fields and the one-dimensional approach make the modeling unrealistic in the upper chromosphere and higher. We discuss these limitations and show that the main results remain valid for any reasonable chromospheric conditions. As in the static case, we find that the ionization of hydrogen in the chromosphere is dominated by collisional excitation in the Lyα transition followed by photoionization by Balmer continuum photons-the Lyman continuum does not play any significant role. In the transition region, collisional ionization from the ground state becomes the primary process. We show that the timescale for ionization/recombination can be estimated from the eigenvalues of a modified rate matrix where the optically thick Lyman transitions that are in detailed balance have been excluded. We find that the timescale for ionization/recombination is dominated by the slow collisional leakage from the ground state to the first excited state. Throughout the chromosphere the timescale is long (103-105 s), except in shocks where the increased temperature and density shorten the timescale for ionization/recombination, especially in the upper chromosphere. Because the relaxation timescale is much longer than dynamic timescales, hydrogen ionization does not have time to reach its equilibrium value and its fluctuations are much smaller than the variation of its statistical equilibrium value appropriate for the instantaneous conditions. Because the ionization and recombination rates increase with increasing temperature and density, ionization in shocks is more rapid than recombination behind them. Therefore, the ionization state tends to represent the higher temperature of the shocks, and the mean electron density is up to a factor of 6 higher than the electron density calculated in statistical equilibrium from the mean atmosphere. The simulations show that a static picture and a dynamic picture of the chromosphere are fundamentally different and that time variations are crucial for our understanding of the chromosphere itself and the spectral features formed there.},

This includes “CN-cycled” models with C/N = 4.07 (solar), 1.5 and 0.5, C/O ranging from 0.09 to (normally) 5.0 to also represent stars of spectral types R, S and N, and with 1.0 ≤ ξ{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}t{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≤ 5 km s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. We also list thermodynamic quantities (T, P\_g, P\_e, ρ, partial pressures of molecules, etc.) and provide them on the World Wide Web, as well as calculated fluxes in approximately 108 000 wavelength points. Underlying assumptions in addition to 1D stratification (spherical or plane-parallel) include hydrostatic equilibrium, mixing-length convection and local thermodynamic equilibrium. We discuss a number of general properties of the models, in particular in relation to the effects of changing abundances, of blanketing, and of sphericity. We illustrate positive and negative feedbacks between sphericity and molecular blanketing. We compare the models with those of other available grids and find excellent agreement with plane-parallel models of Castelli \&amp; Kurucz (if convection is treated consistently) within the overlapping parameter range. Although there are considerable departures from the spherically-symmetric NextGen models, the agreement with more recent PHOENIX models is gratifying. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: The models of the grid show considerable regularities, but some interesting departures from general patterns occur for the coolest models due to the molecular opacities. We have tested a number of approximate “rules of thumb” concerning effects of blanketing and sphericity and often found them to be astonishingly accurate. Some interesting new phenomena have been discovered and explored, such as the intricate coupling between blanketing and sphericity, and the strong effects of carbon enhancement on metal-poor models. We give further details of line absorption data for molecules, as well as details of models and comparisons with observations in subsequent papers.},

This study aims at providing new constraints on dynamo processes in fully convective stars. This paper focuses on five stars of spectral type {\textasciitilde}M4, i.e. with masses close to the full convection threshold ({\textasciitilde}=0.35Msolar), and with short rotational periods. Tomographic imaging techniques allow us to reconstruct the surface magnetic topologies from the rotationally modulated time-series of circularly polarized profiles. We find that all stars host mainly axisymmetric large-scale poloidal fields. Three stars were observed at two different epochs separated by {\textasciitilde}1 yr; we find the magnetic topologies to be globally stable on this time-scale. We also provide an accurate estimation of the rotational period of all stars, thus allowing us to start studying how rotation impacts the large-scale magnetic field.

From the spectroscopic data of LAMOST DR7, we have found one stellar flare that is characterized by an impulsive increase followed by a gradual decrease in the Hα line intensity on an M4-type star, and the total energy radiated through Hα is estimated to be of the order of 1033 erg. The Hα line appears to have a Voigt profile during the flare, which is likely caused by Stark pressure broadening due to the dramatic increase in electron density and/or opacity broadening due to the occurrence of strong nonthermal heating. Obvious enhancement has been identified in the red wing of the Hα line profile after the impulsive increase in the Hα line intensity. The red-wing enhancement corresponds to plasma moving away from the Earth at a velocity of 100-200 km s-1. According to our current knowledge of solar flares, this red-wing enhancement may originate from: (1) flare-driven coronal rain, (2) chromospheric condensation, or (3) a filament/prominence eruption either with nonradial backward propagation or with strong magnetic suppression. The total mass of the moving plasma is estimated to be of the order of 1015 kg.},

	abstract = {Two close-in planets have been recently found around the M-dwarf flare star AU Microscopii (AU Mic). These Neptune-sized planets (AU Mic b and c) seem to be located very close to the so-called "evaporation valley" in the exoplanet population, making this system an important target for studying atmospheric loss on exoplanets. This process, while mainly driven by high-energy stellar radiation, will be strongly mediated by the space environment surrounding the planets. Here we present an investigation of this last area, performing 3D numerical modeling of the quiescent stellar wind from AU Mic, as well as time-dependent simulations describing the evolution of a highly energetic coronal mass ejection (CME) event in this system. Observational constraints on the stellar magnetic field and properties of the eruption are incorporated in our models. We carry out qualitative and quantitative characterizations of the stellar wind, the emerging CMEs, as well as the expected steady and transient conditions along the orbit of both exoplanets. Our results predict extreme space weather for AU Mic and its planets. This includes sub-Alfvénic regions for the large majority of the exoplanet orbits, very high dynamic and magnetic pressure values in quiescence (varying within 102-105 times the dynamic pressure experienced by Earth), and an even harsher environment during the passage of any escaping CME associated with the frequent flaring observed in AU Mic. These space weather conditions alone pose an immense challenge for the survival of exoplanetary atmospheres (if any) in this system.},

Investigations of star–planet interaction and neutral atomic hydrogen absorption during transit to detect magnetic fields in hot Jupiters have been inconclusive, and interpretations of the transit absorption non-unique. In contrast, ionized species escaping a magnetized exoplanet, particularly from the polar caps, should populate the magnetosphere, allowing detection of different regions from the plasmasphere to the extended magnetotail and characterization of the magnetic field producing them. Here we report ultraviolet observations of HAT-P-11 b, a low-mass (0.08 MJ) exoplanet showing strong, phase-extended transit absorption of neutral hydrogen (maximum and tail transit depths of 32 pm 4\% and 27 pm 4\%) and singly ionized carbon (15 pm 4\% and 12.5 pm 4\%). We show that the atmosphere should have less than six times the solar metallicity (at 200 bar), and the exoplanet must also have an extended magnetotail (1.8–3.1 au). The HAT-P-11 b equatorial magnetic field strength should be about 1–5 G. Our panchromatic approach using ionized species to simultaneously derive metallicity and magnetic field strength can now constrain interior and dynamo models of exoplanets, with implications for formation and evolution scenarios.},

	abstract = {Radio synchrotron emission, its polarization and Faraday rotation of the polarization angle are powerful tools to study the strength and structure of magnetic fields in galaxies. Unpolarized synchrotron emission traces isotropic turbulent fields which are strongest in spiral arms and bars (20-30 {\textbackslash}upmu G) and in central starburst regions (50-100 {\textbackslash}upmu G). Such fields are dynamically important; they affect gas flows and drive gas inflows in central regions. Polarized emission traces ordered fields, which can be regular or anisotropic turbulent, where the latter originates from isotropic turbulent fields by the action of compression or shear. The strongest ordered fields (10-15 {\textbackslash}upmu G) are generally found in interarm regions. In galaxies with strong density waves, ordered fields are also observed at the inner edges of spiral arms. Ordered fields with spiral patterns exist in grand-design, barred and flocculent galaxies and in central regions. Ordered fields in interacting galaxies have asymmetric distributions and are a tracer of past interactions between galaxies or with the intergalactic medium.—Faraday rotation measures of the diffuse polarized radio emission from galaxy disks reveal large-scale spiral patterns that can be described by the superposition of azimuthal modes; these are signatures of regular fields generated by mean-field dynamos. "Magnetic arms" between gaseous spiral arms may also be products of dynamo action, but need a stable spiral pattern to develop. Helically twisted field loops winding around spiral arms were found in two galaxies so far. Large-scale field reversals, like the one found in the Milky Way, could not yet be detected in external galaxies. In radio halos around edge-on galaxies, ordered magnetic fields with X-shaped patterns are observed. The origin and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields, in particular their first occurrence in young galaxies and their dynamical importance during galaxy evolution, will be studied with forthcoming radio telescopes like the Square Kilometre Array.},

	abstract = {We present a multi-zone galactic chemical evolution model for the Milky Way that takes into account the updated yields of major nucleosynthesis channels. It incorporates physical processes like radial flow of gas in the disk and infall of fresh gas, along with stellar scattering processes like radial migration. For the first time using a physically motivated model, we qualitatively reproduce the observed \$([\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe/H\}], [{\textbackslash}alpha/\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}])\$ distribution of stars at different Galactic locations, along with the age-\$[{\textbackslash}alpha/\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}]\$ and age-\$\{{\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]\}\$ relations. The model successfully reproduces the bifurcated high- and low-\$[{\textbackslash}alpha/\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}]\$ sequences and sheds light on the origin of the thick disc. We analyse the effect of physical processes individually on the observed properties of the Galaxy. We show that radial flow of gas plays an important role in establishing the radial gradient for both \$\{{\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]\}\$ and \$[{\textbackslash}alpha/\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}]\$. The dichotomy in \$[{\textbackslash}alpha/\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}]\$ is primarily due to the sharp fall of \$[{\textbackslash}alpha/\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}]\$ with time and influenced by star formation history. We identify at least three independent factors that govern the rate of {\textbackslash}alphafe\{\} declining with time: the fraction of white dwarfs that form SNe Ia, the timescale associated with the delay time distribution of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and star formation efficiency. \$\{{\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]\}\$ and \$[{\textbackslash}alpha/\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}]\$ evolve rapidly at early times but change gradually for at least the last 6 Gyr as they approach equilibrium values. The final equilibrium value of \$[{\textbackslash}alpha/\{{\textbackslash}rm Fe\}]\$ is governed by the ratio of SNe Ia to core-collapse supernovae (CCSN).},

	abstract = {Astrometry has long been a promising technique for exoplanet detection. At the theoretical limits, astrometry would allow for the detection of smaller planets than previously seen by current exoplanet search methods, but stellar activity may make these theoretical limits unreachable. Astrometric jitter of a Sun-like star due to magnetic activity in its photosphere induces apparent variability in the photocenter of order 0.5 mR ⊙. This jitter creates a fundamental astrophysical noise floor preventing detection of lower-mass planets in a single spectral band. By injecting planet orbits into simulated solar data at five different passbands, we investigate mitigation of this fundamental astrometric noise using correlations across passbands. For a true solar analog and a planet at 1 au semimajor axis, the 6σ detection limit set by stellar activity for an ideal telescope at the best single passband is 0.01 Earth masses. We found that pairs of passbands with highly correlated astrometric jitter due to stellar activity, but with less motion in the redder band, enable higher-precision measurements of the common signal from the planet. Using this method improves detectable planet masses at 1 au by up to a factor of 10, corresponding to at best 0.005 Earth masses for a Sun-like star with a perfect telescope. Given these results, we recommend that future astrometry missions consider proceeding with two or more passbands to reduce noise due to stellar activity.},

	abstract = {The M dwarf Proxima{\textasciitilde}Centauri is known to be magnetically active and it hosts a likely Earth-like planet in its habitable zone. Understanding the characteristics of stellar radiation by understanding the properties of the emitting plasma is of paramount importance for a proper assessment of the conditions on Proxima{\textasciitilde}Centauri{\textasciitilde}b and exoplanets around M dwarfs in general. We determine the temperature structure of the coronal and transition region plasma of Proxima Centauri from simultaneous X-ray and far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations. The differential emission measure distribution (DEM) was constructed for flaring and quiescent periods by analysing optically thin X-ray and FUV emission lines. Four X-ray observations of Proxima Centauri were conducted by the LETGS instrument on board of the Chandra X-ray Observatory and four FUV observations were carried out using the Hubble STIS spectrograph. From the X-ray light curves, we determined a variation of the quiescent count rate by a factor of two within 20{\textbackslash}\% of the stellar rotation period. To obtain the DEM, 18 optically thin emission lines were analysed (12 X-ray and six FUV). The flare fluxes differ from the quiescence fluxes by factors of 4-20 (FUV) and 1-30 (X-ray). The temperature structure of the stellar corona and transition region was determined for both the quiescence and flaring state by fitting the DEM(T) with Chebyshev polynomials for a temperature range \${\textbackslash}log\$T = 4.25 - 8. Compared to quiescence, the emission measure increases during flares for temperatures below 0.3{\textbackslash},MK (FUV dominated region) and beyond 3.6{\textbackslash},MK (X-ray dominated region). The reconstructed DEM shape provides acceptable line flux predictions compared to the measured values. We provide synthetic spectra at 1-1700 Å, which may be considered as representative for the high-energy irradiation of Proxima{\textasciitilde}Cen{\textasciitilde}b during quiescent and flare periods.},

To understand the importance of these parameters in main-sequence stars, we have assembled a sample of observations that spans a range of these parameters using a combination of observations from The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and the Kepler Space Telescope. We find that while we can measure rotation periods and identify other classes of stellar variability (e.g., pulsations) from TESS light curves, instrument systematics prevent the detection of rotation signals longer than the TESS orbital period of 13.7 days. Due to this detection limit, we also use rotation periods constrained using rotational velocities measured by the APOGEE spectroscopic survey and radii estimated using the Gaia mission for both TESS and Kepler stars. From these rotation periods, we (1) find we can track rotational evolution along discrete mass tracks as a function of stellar age, (2) find we are unable to recover trends between rotation and metallicity that were observed by previous studies, and (3) note that our sample reveals that wide binary companions do not affect rotation, while close binary companions cause stars to exhibit more rapid rotation than single stars.},

	abstract = {With the advent of space-based precision photometry missions, the quantity and quality of starspot light curves has greatly increased. This paper presents a large number of starspot models and their resulting light curves to (1) better determine light-curve metrics and methods that convey useful physical information and (2) understand how the underlying degeneracies of the translation from physical starspot distributions to the resulting light curves obscure that information. We explore models of relatively active stars at several inclinations while varying the number of (dark) spots, random spot distributions in position and time, timescales of growth and decay, and differential rotation. We examine the behavior of absolute and differential variations of individual intensity dips and overall light curves and demonstrate how complex spot distributions and behaviors result in light curves that typically exhibit only one or two dips per rotation. Unfortunately, simplistic "one- or two-spot" or "active longitude" descriptions or modeling of light curves can often be highly misleading. We also show that short "activity cycles" can easily be simply due to random processes. It turns out to be quite difficult to disentangle the competing effects of spot lifetime and differential rotation, but under most circumstances, spot lifetime is the more influential of the two. Many of the techniques tried to date only work when spots live for many rotations. These include autocorrelation degradation for spot lifetimes and periodograms for both global and differential rotation. Differential rotation may be nearly impossible to accurately infer from light curves alone unless spots live for many rotations. The Sun and solar-type stars its age or older are unfortunately the most difficult type of case. Further work is needed to have increased confidence in light-curve inferences.},

	abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

From this in-between position, brown dwarfs offer unique insights into the nature and origins of both stars and planets. Until now it has not been possible to measure the fundamental physical properties of brown dwarfs directly. But with the discovery of two young brown dwarfs in an eclipsing binary system in the Orion Nebula star-forming region, it has been possible to measure the mass and radius of two in one go. Surprisingly, the less-massive brown dwarf is the hotter of the pair; a finding that runs contrary to the predictions of all current theoretical models of coeval brown dwarfs. This might mean that the two brown dwarfs did not form at the same time, but got together in the recent past.},

The first important developments were devoted to the description of their mechanical structure, with the derivation of an appropriate equation of state, and the modelling of their atmosphere characterised by strong molecular absorption. New challenges are arising with progress in observational techniques which provide data of unprecedented accuracy. The goal of this chapter is to describe some of the current challenges for the theory of brown dwarfs. Those challenges concern atmospheric dust and cloud, non-equilibrium atmospheric chemistry, the effect of rotation and magnetic fields on internal structure and the very early phases of evolution characterised by accretion processes. The field remains lively as more and more high-quality observational data become available and because of increasing discoveries of exoplanets. Indeed, many physical properties of giant exoplanets can be described by the same theory as brown dwarfs, as described in this chapter.},

These are weaker by a factor of about 2 than the fields we obtained in previous magnetic models of two other cool dwarfs (GJ 65A/B). Our results suggest that Tr-1 possesses a global poloidal field that is ∼100 times stronger than the Sun's global field. In the context of exoplanets in orbit around Tr-1, the strong poloidal fields on the star may help to protect the planets from the potentially destructive effects of coronal mass ejections. This, in combination with previous arguments about the beneficial effects of flare photons in the ultraviolet and visible portions of the spectrum, suggests that conditions on Tr-1 are not necessarily harmful to life on a planet in the habitable zone of Tr-1.},

Here, modern methods of magnetic field measurements applied to M-dwarf stars are reviewed, with an emphasis on direct diagnostics based on interpretation of the Zeeman effect signatures in high-resolution intensity and polarisation spectra. Results of the mean field strength measurements derived from Zeeman broadening analyses as well as information on the global magnetic geometries inferred by applying tomographic mapping methods to spectropolarimetric observations are summarised and critically evaluated.

	abstract = {Empirical trends in stellar X-ray and radio luminosities suggest that low-mass ultracool dwarfs (UCDs) should not produce significant radio emission. Defying these expectations, strong nonthermal emission has been observed in a few UCDs in the 1–10 GHz range, with a variable component often attributed to global aurorae and a steady component attributed to other processes, such as gyrosynchrotron emission. While both auroral and gyrosynchrotron emission peak near the critical frequency, only the latter radiation is expected to extend into millimeter wavelengths. We present Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) 97.5 GHz and Very Large Array 33 GHz observations of a small survey of 5 UCDs. LP 349-25, LSR J1835+3259, and NLTT 33370 were detected at 97.5 GHz, while LP 423-31 and LP 415-20 resulted in nondetections at 33 GHz. A significant flare was observed in NLTT 33370, which reached a peak flux of 4880 ± 360 μJy, exceeding the quiescent flux by nearly an order of magnitude and lasting 20 s. These ALMA observations show bright 97.5 GHz emission with spectral indices ranging from α = 0.76 to α = −0.29, suggestive of optically thin gyrosynchrotron emission. If such emission traces magnetic reconnection events, then this could have consequences for both UCD magnetic models and the atmospheric stability of planets in orbit around them. Overall, our results provide confirmation that gyrosynchrotron radiation in radio-loud UCDs can remain detectable into the millimeter regime.},

	abstract = {Nanoflares in quiet-Sun regions during solar cycle 24 are studied with the best available plasma diagnostics to derive their energy distribution and contribution to coronal heating during different levels of solar activity. Extreme ultraviolet (EUV) filters of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) are used. We analyze 30 AIA/SDO image series between 2011 and 2018, each covering a \$400 {\textbackslash}times 400\$ arcsec quiet-Sun field-of-view over two hours with a 12-second cadence. Differential emission measure (DEM) analysis is used to derive the emission measure (EM) and temperature evolution for each pixel. We detect nanoflares as EM-enhancements using a threshold-based algorithm and derive their thermal energy from the DEM observations. Nanoflare energy distributions follow power-laws that show slight variations in steepness (\${\textbackslash}alpha =\$ 2.02 to 2.47) but no correlation to the solar activity level. The combined nanoflare distribution of all data sets covers five orders of magnitude in event energies (\$10{\textasciicircum}\{24\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textasciitilde}to{\textasciitilde}\} 10{\textasciicircum}\{29\} {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textasciitilde}erg\}\$) with a power-law index \${\textbackslash}alpha=2.28 {\textbackslash}pm0.03\$. The derived mean energy flux of \$(3.7{\textbackslash}pm 1.6){\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}4{\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textasciitilde}erg{\textasciitilde}cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ is one order of magnitude smaller than the coronal heating requirement. We find no correlation between the derived energy flux and solar activity. Analysis of the spatial distribution reveals clusters of high energy flux (up to \$3{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}5 {\textbackslash}mathrm\{{\textasciitilde}erg{\textasciitilde}cm{\textasciicircum}\{-2\}{\textasciitilde}s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$) surrounded by extended regions with lower activity. Comparisons with magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) demonstrate that high-activity clusters are located preferentially in the magnetic network and above regions of enhanced magnetic flux density.},

We find that all targeted stars are consistent with a common value of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$=1.984 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.019 for the exponent of the flare frequency distribution. From multi-epoch high-resolution spectroscopy, we determine the stellar radial velocity which, when combined with Gaia astrometry, permits us to determine the galactic UVW space motions. We find that 64\% of our stars are members of the thin disk in the Galaxy, 5\% belong to the thick disk, and for the remaining 31\%, we cannot confidently assign membership to either component. If we assume that star formation has been constant in the thin disk for the past 8 Gyr, then based on the fraction that we observe to be active, we estimate the average age at which these stars transition from the saturated to the unsaturated flaring regime to be 2.4 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 0.3 Gyr. This is consistent with the ages that we assign from galactic kinematics: We find that stars with Prot \${\textless}\$ 10 days (which have yet to spin down) have a mean age of 2.0 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 1.2 Gyr, whereas stars with 10 \${\textless}\$ Prot \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 90 days have a mean age of 5.6 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 2.7 Gyr, and stars with Prot \${\textgreater}\$ 90 days have a mean age of 12.9 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 3.5 Gyr.

	abstract = {A number of radio-loud ultra-cool dwarf (UCD) stars exhibit both continuous broadband and highly polarized pulsed radio emission. In order to determine the nature of the emission and the physical characteristics in the source region, we have made multi-epoch, wideband spectral observations of TVLM 0513-46 and 2M 0746+20. We combine these observations with archival radio data to fully characterize both the temporal and spectral properties of the radio emission. The continuum spectral energy distribution can be well modeled using gyrosynchrotron emission from mildly relativistic electrons in a dipolar field. The pulsed emission exhibits a variety of time-variable characteristics, including frequency drifts, frequency cutoffs, and multiple pulses per period. For 2M 0746+20 we determine a pulse period consistent with previously determined values. We modeled locations of pulsed emission using an oblique rotating magnetospheric model with beamed electron-cyclotron maser (ECM) sources. The best-fit models have narrow ECM beaming angles aligned with the local source magnetic field direction, except for one isolated burst from 2M 0746+20. For TVLM 0513-46, the best-fit rotation axis inclination is nearly orthogonal to the line of sight. For 2M 0746+20 we found a good fit using a fixed inclination i=36\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ , determined from optical observations. For both stars the ECM sources are located near feet of magnetic loops with radial extents 1.2Rs-2.7Rs and surface fields 2.2-2.5 kG. These results support recent suggestions that radio over-luminous UCDs have a global “weak field” non-axisymmetric magnetic topologies.},

	abstract = {Stellar flares have been extensively studied in soft X-rays (SXRs) by basically every X-ray mission. Hard X-ray (HXR) emission from stellar superflares, however, have only been detected from a handful of objects over the past years. One very extreme event was the superflare from the young M-dwarf DG CVn binary star system, which triggered Swift/BAT as if it was a γ-ray burst. In this work, we estimate the expected γ-ray emission from DG CVn and the most extreme stellar flares by extrapolating from solar flares based on measured solar energetic particles (SEPs), as well as thermal and non-thermal emission properties. We find that ions are plausibly accelerated in stellar superflares to 100 GeV energies, and possibly up to TeV energies in the associated coronal mass ejections. The corresponding π0-decay γ-ray emission could be detectable from stellar superflares with ground-based γ-ray telescopes. On the other hand, the detection of γ-ray emission implies particle densities high enough that ions suffer significant losses due to inelastic proton-proton scattering. The next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) should be able to probe superflares from M dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood and constrain the energy in interacting cosmic rays and/or their maximum energy. The detection of γ-ray emission from stellar flares would open a new window for the study of stellar physics, the underlying physical processes in flares and their impact on habitability of planetary systems.},

Five of these are planet candidates with Msini{\textless}12 MJUP, two are brown dwarf candidates with Msini{\textasciitilde}30 MJUP, and three are low-mass stellar companions. Hipparcos astrometry reveals the orbital inclinations and masses for three of the (more massive) companions, and it provides upper limits to the masses for the rest. A new class of extrasolar planet is emerging, characterized by nearly circular orbits and orbital radii greater than 1 AU. The planet HD 4208b appears to be a member of this new class. The mass distribution of extrasolar planets continues to exhibit a rapid rise from 10 MJUP toward the lowest detectable masses near 1 MSAT.

	abstract = {During its two-year prime mission, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) will perform a time-series photometric survey covering over 80\% of the sky. This survey comprises observations of 26 24° × 96° sectors that are each monitored continuously for approximately 27 days. The main goal of TESS is to find transiting planets around 200,000 pre-selected stars for which fixed aperture photometry is recorded every two minutes. However, TESS is also recording and delivering full-frame images (FFIs) of each detector at a 30-minutes cadence. We have created an open-source tool, eleanor, to produce light curves for objects in the TESS FFIs. Here, we describe the methods used in eleanor to produce light curves that are optimized for planet searches. The tool performs background subtraction; aperture and point-spread function photometry; decorrelation of instrument systematics; and cotrending using principal component analysis. We recover known transiting exoplanets in the FFIs to validate the pipeline and perform a limited search for new planet candidates in Sector 1. Our tests indicate that eleanor produces light curves with significantly less scatter than other tools that have been used in the literature. Cadence-stacked images, and raw and detrended eleanor light curves for each analyzed star will be hosted on Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, with planet candidates on ExoFOP-TESS as Community TESS Objects of Interest. This work confirms the promise that the TESS FFIs will enable the detection of thousands of new exoplanets and a broad range of time domain astrophysics.},

In the present work, we show how the Gaia data allows us to study variability phenomena connected to the stellar magnetic activity and occurs on very different timescales.

Upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time will explore the parameter space of astrophysical transients at all time-scales, and offer the opportunity to discover even more extreme examples of unexpected phenomena. We investigate strategies to identify novel objects and to contextualize them within large time-series data sets in order to facilitate the discovery of new classes of objects as well as the physical interpretation of their anomalous nature. We develop a method that combines tree-based and manifold-learning algorithms for anomaly detection in order to perform two tasks: 1) identify and rank anomalous objects in a time-domain data set; and 2) group those anomalies according to their similarity in order to identify analogues. We achieve the latter by combining an anomaly score from a tree-based method with a dimensionality manifold-learning reduction strategy. Clustering in the reduced space allows for the successful identification of anomalies and analogues. We also assess the impact of pre-processing and feature engineering schemes and investigate the astrophysical nature of the objects that our models identify as anomalous by augmenting the Kepler data with Gaia colour and luminosity information. We find that multiple models, used in combination, are a promising strategy to identify novel light curves and light curve families.},

	abstract = {We have analysed the differences in positions of 9081 matched sources between the Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) catalogues. The median position uncertainty of matched sources in the VLBI catalogue is a factor of two larger than the median position uncertainty in Gaia DR2. There are 9 per cent matched sources with statistically significant offsets between both catalogues. We found that the reported positional errors should be rescaled by a factor of 1.3 for VLBI and 1.06 for Gaia and, in addition, the Gaia errors should be multiplied by the square root of chi squared per degree of freedom in order to best fit the normalized position differences to the Rayleigh distribution. We have established that the major contributor to statistically significant position offsets is the presence of optical jets. Among the sources for which the jet direction was determined, the position offsets are parallel to the jet directions for 62 per cent of the outliers. Among the matched sources with significant proper motion, the fraction of objects with proper motion directions parallel to jets is a factor of three greater than on average. Such sources have systematically higher chi squared per degree of freedom. We explain these proper motions as a manifestation of the source position jitter caused by flares, which we predicted earlier. Therefore, the assumption that quasars are fixed points, and thus that differential proper motions determined with respect to quasar photocentres can be regarded as absolute proper motions, should be treated with great caution.},

This presents both problems and opportunities for observational astronomy. Small satellites offer complementary cost-effective capabilities to both ground-based astronomy and larger space missions. Compared with ground-based astronomy, these advantages are not just in the accessibility of wavelength ranges where the Earth's atmosphere is opaque, but also in stable, high-precision photometry, long-term monitoring and improved areal coverage. Astronomy has a long history of new observational parameter spaces leading to major discoveries. Here we discuss the potential for small satellites to explore new parameter spaces in astrophysics, drawing on examples from current and proposed missions, and spanning a wide range of science goals from binary stars, exoplanets and Solar System science to the early Universe and fundamental physics.},

However, not enough is known about the stars flare and quiescent emission, which powers photochemical reactions on the atmospheres of possible planets. Over its initial 1-year mission, SPARCS will stare at {\textasciitilde}10 stars in order to measure short- (minutes) and long- (months) term variability simultaneously in the near-UV (NUV - lam = 280 nm) and far-UV (FUV - lam = 162 nm). The SPARCS payload consists of a 9-cm reflector telescope paired with two high-sensitivity 2D-doped CCDs. The detectors are kept passively cooled at 238K, in order to reduce dark-current contribution. The filters have been selected to provide strong rejection of longer wavelengths, where most of the starlight is emitted. The payload will be integrated within a 6U CubeSat to be placed on a Sun-synchronous terminator orbit, allowing for long observing stares for all targets.

	abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is a large (6.6 m), cold ({\textless}50 K), infrared (IR)-optimized space observatory that will be launched early in the next decade into orbit around the second Earth Sun Lagrange point. The observatory will have four instruments: a near-IR camera, a near-IR multiobject spectrograph, and a tunable filter imager will cover the wavelength range, 0.6 {\textless} ; {\textless} 5.0 μ m, while the mid-IR instrument will do both imaging and spectroscopy from 5.0 {\textless} ; {\textless} 29 μ m. The JWST science goals are divided into four themes. The key objective of The End of the Dark Ages: First Light and Reionization theme is to identify the first luminous sources to form and to determine the ionization history of the early universe. The key objective of The Assembly of Galaxies theme is to determine how galaxies and the dark matter, gas, stars, metals, morphological structures, and active nuclei within them evolved from the epoch of reionization to the present day. The key objective of The Birth of Stars and Protoplanetary Systems theme is to unravel the birth and early evolution of stars, from infall on to dust-enshrouded protostars to the genesis of planetary systems. The key objective of the Planetary Systems and the Origins of Life theme is to determine the physical and chemical properties of planetary systems including our own, and investigate the potential for the origins of life in those systems. Within these themes and objectives, we have derived representative astronomical observations. To enable these observations, JWST consists of a telescope, an instrument package, a spacecraft, and a sunshield. The telescope consists of 18 beryllium segments, some of which are deployed. The segments will be brought into optical alignment on-orbit through a process of periodic wavefront sensing and control. The instrument package contains the four science instruments and a fine guidance sensor. The spacecraft provides pointing, orbit maintenance, and communications. The sunshield provides passive thermal control. The JWST operations plan is based on that used for previous space observatories, and the majority of JWST observing time will be allocated to the international astronomical community through annual peer-reviewed proposal opportunities.},

	abstract = {The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a new robotic time-domain survey currently in progress using the Palomar 48-inch Schmidt Telescope. ZTF uses a 47 square degree field with a 600 megapixel camera to scan the entire northern visible sky at rates of ∼3760 square degrees/hour to median depths of g ∼ 20.8 and r ∼ 20.6 mag (AB, 5σ in 30 sec). We describe the Science Data System that is housed at IPAC, Caltech. This comprises the data-processing pipelines, alert production system, data archive, and user interfaces for accessing and analyzing the products. The real-time pipeline employs a novel image-differencing algorithm, optimized for the detection of point-source transient events. These events are vetted for reliability using a machine-learned classifier and combined with contextual information to generate data-rich alert packets. The packets become available for distribution typically within 13 minutes (95th percentile) of observation. Detected events are also linked to generate candidate moving-object tracks using a novel algorithm. Objects that move fast enough to streak in the individual exposures are also extracted and vetted. We present some preliminary results of the calibration performance delivered by the real-time pipeline. The reconstructed astrometric accuracy per science image with respect to Gaia DR1 is typically 45 to 85 milliarcsec. This is the RMS per-axis on the sky for sources extracted with photometric S/N ≥ 10 and hence corresponds to the typical astrometric uncertainty down to this limit. The derived photometric precision (repeatability) at bright unsaturated fluxes varies between 8 and 25 millimag. The high end of these ranges corresponds to an airmass approaching ∼2—the limit of the public survey. Photometric calibration accuracy with respect to Pan-STARRS1 is generally better than 2\%. The products support a broad range of scientific applications: fast and young supernovae; rare flux transients; variable stars; eclipsing binaries; variability from active galactic nuclei; counterparts to gravitational wave sources; a more complete census of Type Ia supernovae; and solar-system objects.},

This change fosters the development of data-driven science as a useful companion to the common model-driven data analysis paradigm, where astronomers develop automatic tools to mine datasets and extract novel information from them. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become increasingly popular among astronomers, and are now used for a wide variety of tasks. In light of these developments, and the promise and challenges associated with them, the IAC Winter School 2018 focused on big data in Astronomy, with a particular emphasis on machine learning and deep learning techniques. This document summarizes the topics of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms presented during the school, and provides practical information on the application of such tools to astronomical datasets. In this document I cover basic topics in supervised machine learning, including selection and preprocessing of the input dataset, evaluation methods, and three popular supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and shallow Artificial Neural Networks. My main focus is on unsupervised machine learning algorithms, that are used to perform cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, visualization, and outlier detection. Unsupervised learning algorithms are of particular importance to scientific research, since they can be used to extract new knowledge from existing datasets, and can facilitate new discoveries.},

	abstract = {Many low-mass pre-main-sequence stars exhibit strong magnetic activity and coronal X-ray emission. Even after the primordial accretion disk has been cleared out, the star's high-energy radiation continues to affect the formation and evolution of dust, planetesimals, and large planets. Young stars with debris disks are thus ideal environments for studying the earliest stages of non-accretion-driven coronae. In this paper we simulate the corona of AU Mic, a nearby active M dwarf with an edge-on debris disk. We apply a self-consistent model of coronal loop heating that was derived from numerical simulations of solar field-line tangling and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. We also synthesize the modeled star's X-ray luminosity and thermal radio/millimeter continuum emission. A realistic set of parameter choices for AU Mic produces simulated observations that agree with all existing measurements and upper limits. This coronal model thus represents an alternative explanation for a recently discovered ALMA central emission peak that was suggested to be the result of an inner "asteroid belt" within 3 AU of the star. However, it is also possible that the central 1.3 mm peak is caused by a combination of active coronal emission and a bright inner source of dusty debris. Additional observations of this source's spatial extent and spectral energy distribution at millimeter and radio wavelengths will better constrain the relative contributions of the proposed mechanisms.},

We detected 145 white-light flares from the TESS light-curve and four Hα flares from the OISTER observations performed between 2019 January 16 and 18. Among them, three Halpha flares were associated with white-light flares. However, one of them did not show clear brightening in the continuum; during this flare, the Hα line exhibited blue asymmetry which lasted for about 60 min. The line-of-sight velocity of the blueshifted component is in the range from -80 to -100 km s-1. This suggests that there can be upward flows of chromospheric cool plasma even without detectable red/near-infrared (NIR) continuum brightening. By assuming that the blue asymmetry in the Hlalpha line was caused by a prominence eruption on YZ CMi, we estimated the mass and kinetic energy of the upward-moving material to be 1016-1018 g and 1029.5-1031.5 erg, respectively. The estimated mass is comparable to expectations from the empirical relation between the flare X-ray energy and mass of upward-moving material for stellar flares and solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In contrast, the estimated kinetic energy for the non-white-light flare on YZ CMi is roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than that expected from the relation between flare X-ray energy and kinetic energy for solar CMEs. This could be understood by the difference in the velocity between CMEs and prominence eruptions.},

	abstract = {We report on the discovery of a bound exoplanetary microlensing event from a blind search of data gathered from Campaign 9 of the Kepler K2 mission (K2C9). K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb is a densely sampled, binary caustic-crossing microlensing event with caustic entry and exit points that are resolved in the K2C9 data, enabling the lens-source relative proper motion to be measured. We have fitted a binary microlens model to the K2 dataset, and to simultaneous observations from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE-IV), Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics (MOA-2), the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet), and the United Kingdom InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT). Whilst the ground-based data only sparsely sample the binary caustic, they provide a clear detection of parallax that allows us to break completely the microlensing mass-position-velocity degeneracy and measure the planet's mass directly. We find a host mass of \$0.58{\textbackslash}pm0.03 {\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and a planetary mass of \$1.1 {\textbackslash}pm 0.1 {\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_J\}\$. The system lies at a distance of \$5.2 {\textbackslash}pm 0.2{\textasciitilde}\$kpc from Earth towards the Galactic bulge. The projected physical separation of the planet from its host is found to be \$4.2 {\textbackslash}pm 0.3{\textasciitilde}\$au which, for circular orbits, corresponds to \$a = 4.4{\textasciicircum}\{+1.9\}\_\{-0.4\}{\textasciitilde}\$au and period \$P = 13{\textasciicircum}\{+9\}\_\{-2\}{\textasciitilde}\$yr, making K2-2016-BLG-0005Lb a close Jupiter analogue. Though previous exoplanet microlensing events have included space-based data, this event is the first bound microlensing exoplanet to be discovered from space-based data. Even through a space telescope not designed for microlensing studies, this result highlights the advantages for exoplanet microlensing discovery that come from continuous, high-cadence temporal sampling that is possible from space.

EV Lac always possesses the Halpha emission line; however, its intensity was stronger on 2015 August 15 than during the other four night periods. On this night, we observed a rapid rise (about 20 min) and a subsequent slow decrease (about 1.5 hr) of the emission-line intensity of Hα, which was probably caused by a flare. We also found an asymmetrical change in the Hα line on the same night. The enhancement has been observed in the blue wing of the Hα line during each phase of this flare (from the flare start to the flare end), and absorption components were present in its red wing during the early and later phases of the flare. Such blue enhancement (blue asymmetry) of the Halpha line is sometimes seen during solar flares, but only during the early phases. Even for solar flares, little is known about the origin of the blue asymmetry. Compared with solar flare models, the presented results can lead to better understanding of the dynamics of stellar flares.},

Active M dwarfs frequently exhibit large flares, which can pose an existential threat to the habitability of any planet in orbit in addition to making said planets more difficult to detect. M dwarfs do not lose angular momentum as easily as earlier-type stars, which maintain the high levels of stellar activity for far longer. Studying young, fast-rotating M dwarfs is key to understanding their near stellar environment and the evolution of activity. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We study stellar activity on the fast-rotating M dwarf GJ 3270. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We analyzed dedicated high cadence, simultaneous, photometric and high-resolution spectroscopic observations obtained with CARMENES of GJ 3270 over 7.7 h, covering a total of eight flares of which two are strong enough to facilitate a detailed analysis. We consult the TESS data, obtained in the month prior to our own observations, to study rotational modulation and to compare the TESS flares to those observed in our campaign. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The TESS data exhibit rotational modulation with a period of 0.37 d. The strongest flare covered by our observing campaign released a total energy of about 3.6 x 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}32{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg, putting it close to the superflare regime. This flare is visible in the B,V, r, i, and z photometric bands, which allows us to determine a peak temperature of about 10 000 K. The flare also leaves clear marks in the spectral time series. In particular, we observe an evolving, mainly blue asymmetry in chromospheric lines, which we attribute to a post-flare, corotating feature. To our knowledge this is the first time such a feature has been seen on a star other than our Sun. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our photometric and spectroscopic time series covers the eruption of a strong flare followed up by a corotating feature analogous to a post-flare arcadal loop on the Sun with a possible failed ejection of material.},

Equivalent widths or upper limits for the Li I 6708 Å line are reported and the lithium depletion boundary (LDB) age of the BPMG is revisited. Whilst non-magnetic evolutionary models still yield an estimated age of 21 ± 4 Myr, models that incorporate magnetic inhibition of convection imply an older age of 24 ± 4 Myr. A similar systematic increase would be inferred if the stars were 25 per cent covered by dark magnetic starspots. Since young, convective M-dwarfs are magnetically active and do have starspots, we suggest that the original LDB age estimate is a lower limit. The LDB age of the ABDMG is still poorly constrained - non-magnetic evolutionary models suggest an age in the range 35-150 Myr, which could be significantly tightened by new measurements for existing candidate members.},

	abstract = {Binks \& Jeffries and Malo et al. have recently reported Li depletion boundary (LDB) ages for the beta Pictoris moving group (BPMG) which are twice as old as the oft-cited kinematic age of about 12 Myr. In this study, we present (1) a new evaluation of the internal kinematics of the BPMG using the revised Hipparcos astrometry and best available published radial velocities, and assess whether a useful kinematic age can be derived, and (2) derive an isochronal age based on the placement of the A-, F-, and G-type stars in the colour-magnitude diagram (CMD). We explore the kinematics of the BPMG looking at velocity trends along Galactic axes, and conducting traceback analyses assuming linear trajectories, epicyclic orbit approximation, and orbit integration using a realistic gravitational potential. None of the methodologies yield a kinematic age with small uncertainties using modern velocity data. Expansion in the Galactic X and Y directions is significant only at the 1.7sigma and 2.7sigma levels, and together yields an overall kinematic age with a wide range (13-58 Myr; 95 per cent CL). The A-type members are all on the zero-age main sequence, suggestive of an age of {\textgreater}20 Myr, and the loci of the CMD positions for the late-F- and G-type pre-main-sequence BPMG members have a median isochronal age of 22 Myr (pm 3 Myr statistical, pm1 Myr systematic) when considering four sets of modern theoretical isochrones. The results from recent LDB and isochronal age analyses are now in agreement with a median BPMG age of 23 pm 3 Myr (overall 1sigma uncertainty, including pm2 Myr statistical and pm2 Myr systematic uncertainties).},

We performed a four-orbit reconnaissance with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope to study the stellar emission at Lyman-α, to assess the presence of hydrogen exospheres around the two inner planets, and to determine their UV irradiation. We detect the Lyman-alpha line of TRAPPIST-1, making it the coldest exoplanet host star for which this line has been measured. We reconstruct the intrinsic line profile, showing that it lacks broad wings and is much fainter than expected from the stellar X-ray emission. TRAPPIST-1 has a similar X-ray emission as Proxima Cen but a much lower Ly-alpha emission. This suggests that TRAPPIST-1 chromosphere is only moderately active compared to its transition region and corona. We estimated the atmospheric mass loss rates for all planets, and found that despite a moderate extreme UV emission the total XUV irradiation could be strong enough to strip the atmospheres of the inner planets in a few billions years. We detect marginal flux decreases at the times of TRAPPIST-1b and c transits, which might originate from stellar activity, but could also hint at the presence of extended hydrogen exospheres. Understanding the origin of these Lyman-alpha variations will be crucial in assessing the atmospheric stability and potential habitability of the TRAPPIST-1 planets.},

Here, we investigate the propagation of Galactic cosmic rays as they travel through the stellar winds (astrospheres) of five nearby M dwarfs, namely: GJ 15A, GJ 273, GJ 338B, GJ 411 and GJ 887. Our selected stars each have 1 or 2 detected exoplanets and they all have wind mass-loss rates constrained by Lyman-alpha observations. Our simulations use a combined 1D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Alfv{\textbackslash}'en-wave-driven stellar wind model and 1D cosmic ray transport model. We find that GJ 411 and GJ 887 have Galactic cosmic rays fluxes comparable with Earth's at their habitable zones. On the other hand, GJ 15A, GJ 273 and GJ 338B receive a lower Galactic cosmic ray flux in their habitable zones. All exoplanets in our sample, with exception of GJ 15A c and GJ 411 c, have a significantly lower flux of Galactic cosmic rays than values observed at the Earth because they orbit closer-in. The fluxes found here can be further used for chemical modelling of planetary atmospheres. Finally, we calculate the radiation dose at the surface of the habitable-zone planet GJ 273 b, assuming it has an Earth-like atmosphere. This planet receives up to 209 times less 15 MeV energy cosmic ray fluxes than values observed at Earth. However, for high-energy cosmic rays (about GeV), the difference in flux is only 2.3 times smaller, which contributes to GJ 273 b receiving a significant surface radiation dose of 0.13 mSv/yr (40\% of the annual dose on Earth's surface).},

	abstract = {We report the detection and follow-up of a superstellar flare GWAC 181229A with an amplitude of dR R of 9.5 mag on an M9-type star by SVOM/GWAC and the dedicated follow-up telescopes. The estimated bolometric energy Ebol is (5.56-9.25) x 1034 erg, which makes the event one of the most powerful flares seen on ultracool stars. The magnetic strength is inferred to be 3.6-4.7 kG. Thanks to sampling with a cadence of 15 s, a new component near the peak time with a very steep decay is detected in the R-band light curve, followed by the two-component flare template given by Davenport et al. An effective temperature of 5340 ± 40 K is measured by fitting a blackbody shape to the spectrum in the shallower phase during the flare. The filling factors of the flare are estimated to be 30\% and 19\% at the peak time and at 54 minutes after the first detection. The detection of this particular event with large amplitude, huge emitted energy, and a new component demonstrates that high-cadence sky monitoring cooperation with fast follow-up observations is very important for understanding the violent magnetic activity.},

	abstract = {Context. The beta Pictoris moving group is one of the most well-known young associations in the solar neighbourhood and several members are known to host circumstellar discs, planets, and comets. Measuring its age precisely is essential to the study of several astrophysical processes, such as planet formation and disc evolution, which are strongly age-dependent. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to determine a precise and accurate dynamical traceback age for the beta Pictoris moving group. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Our sample combines the extremely precise Gaia DR2 astrometry with ground-based radial velocities measured in an homogeneous manner. We use an updated version of our algorithm to determine dynamical ages. The new approach takes into account a robust estimate of the spatial and kinematic covariance matrices of the association to improve the sample selection process and to perform the traceback analysis. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We estimate a dynamical age of 18.5{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-2.4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+2.0{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} Myr for the β Pictoris moving group. We investigated the spatial substructure of the association at the time of birth and we propose the existence of a core of stars that is more concentrated. We also provide precise radial velocity measurements for 81 members of beta Pic, including ten stars with the first determinations of their radial velocities. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our dynamical traceback age is three times more precise than previous traceback age estimates and, more importantly, for the first time it reconciles the traceback age with the most recent estimates of other dynamical, lithium depletion boundaries and isochronal ages. This has been possible thanks to the excellent astrometric and spectroscopic precisions, the homogeneity of our sample, and the detailed analysis of binaries and membership.},

HD 189733 is one of the key exosystems thought to harbor magnetic interactions, which may have been detected in August 2013. We present a set of twelve wind models at that period, covering the possible coronal states and coronal topologies of HD 189733 at that time. We assess the power available for the magnetic interaction and predict its temporal modulation. By comparing the predicted signal with the observed signal, we find that some models could be compatible with an interpretation based on star-planet magnetic interactions. We also find that the observed signal can be explained only with a stretch-and-break interaction mechanism, while that the Alfv{\textbackslash}'en wings scenario cannot deliver enough power. We finally demonstrate that the past observational cadence of HD 189733 leads to a detection rate of only between 12 to 23\%, which could explain why star-planet interactions have been hard to detect in past campaigns. We conclude that the firm confirmation of their detection will require dedicated spectroscopic observations covering densely the orbital and rotation period, combined with scarcer spectropolarimetric observations to assess the concomitant large-scale magnetic topology of the star.},

	abstract = {The alignment of planetary orbits with respect to the stellar rotation preserves information on their dynamical histories. Measuring this angle for young planets help illuminate the mechanisms that create misaligned orbits for older planets, as different processes could operate over timescales ranging from a few Myr to a Gyr. We present spectroscopic transit observations of the young exoplanet V1298 Tau b; we update the age of V1298 Tau to be \$28{\textbackslash}pm4\$ Myr based on Gaia EDR3 measurements. We observed a partial transit with Keck/HIRES and LBT/PEPSI, and detected the radial velocity anomaly due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. V1298 Tau{\textasciitilde}b has a prograde, well-aligned orbit, with \${\textbackslash}lambda = 4\_\{-10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+7 {\textbackslash}circ\}\$. By combining the spectroscopically-measured \$v{\textbackslash}sin i\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ and the phtometrically-measured rotation period of the host star we also find that the orbit is aligned in 3D, \${\textbackslash}psi = 8\_\{-7\}{\textasciicircum}\{+4 {\textbackslash}circ\}\$ deg. Finally, we combine our obliquity constraints with a previous measurement for the interior planet V1298 Tau c to constrain the mutual inclination between the two planets to be \$i\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mut\}\}=0{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\} {\textbackslash}pm 19{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$. This measurements adds to the growing number of well-aligned planets at young ages, hinting that misalignments may be generated over timescales of longer than tens of Myr. The number of measurements, however, is still small, and this population may not be representative of the older planets that have been observed to date. We also present the derivation of the relationship between \$i\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{mut\}\}\$, \${\textbackslash}lambda\$, and \$i\$ for two planets.},

We present line identifications, fluxes, Doppler shifts, and widths. Doppler shifts are measured with respect to heliocentric wavelength scales determined from interstellar absorption lines, and are compared with transition region line shifts seen in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ultraviolet spectra. For the warmer stars the O VI lines extend the trend of increasing redshift with line formation temperature, but for the cooler stars the O VI line redshifts are essentially zero. The C III and O VI lines of most stars in the sample are best fit with two Gaussians, and we confirm the correlation of increasing importance of the broad component with increasing stellar activity. The nonthermal velocities of the narrow component are subsonic and exhibit a trend toward larger velocities with decreasing surface gravity, while the nonthermal velocities of the broad components show no obvious trend with stellar gravity. The C III and O VI lines of Altair show unique broad horned profiles. Two flares were observed on AU Mic. One shows increasing continuum flux to shorter wavelengths, which we interpret as free-free emission from hot plasma, and relatively narrow, redshifted C III and O VI emission. The other shows very broad line profiles.},

The data consist of medium-resolution echelle spectra covering the wavelength region from 1170 to 1730 Å with a spectral resolution of λ/Δλ=45,800. The observations were obtained using the TIME-TAG observing mode in which the time and position of each detected photon is recorded. This allows a study of variability that is constrained only by counting statistics. During a total on-source time of 10,105 s, we observed numerous microflare bursts as well as four well-defined flare events. These flares lasted between 10 s and 3 minutes and were most easily detected in the FUV continuum and the Si IV and C IV resonance lines. Variations in both the cooler (e.g., Lyα, C II, O I) and hotter (O V, N V, Fe XXI) emission lines were much less pronounced. We examined the physical characteristics of the flare events, including the time history of the wavelength-integrated fluxes in the continuum and the various emission lines. In particular, we searched for, but did not find, evidence for increased emission in the red wing of the Lyα line, which would indicate the presence of moderately energetic proton beams. We integrated the emission over the entire time of major flare activity to investigate the average line and continuum properties of the time-averaged spectrum, including flows and turbulence as a function of temperature. We also considered the shape of the FUV continuum, which may actually be caused by the enhancement of numerous weak emission lines. Unfortunately, none of the events were strong enough to allow a detailed examination of line profiles as a function of time.},

	abstract = {Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) observations of the long-duration 1992 July 15-17 flaring event on the red dwarf star AU Mic are discussed. The flare was detected in the EUVE Deep Survey (DS) Lexan/B band (65-190 Å) and was made up of a large impulsive event corresponding to an increase in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission by a factor of 15 relative to quiescence, followed by a slow exponential decay interspersed with another smaller impulsive event and further decay. As observed in the EUV, the flare lasted for more than half a day. A similar exponential decay of the flux in the Fe XVIII λ93.9 line was detected in the EUVE short wavelength (SW) spectrometer following the first powerful impulsive phase. The flare decay in the 65-190 Å band and in the Fe XVIII line during this prolonged event lasted a factor of 10 or more longer than would have been the case had the plasma cooling been due only to radiative losses at typical flare plasma densities. An analysis of the simultaneous DS Lexan/B data and the Fe XVIII line flux has allowed us to determine the approximate temporal behavior of the flaring plasma temperature (d log T/dt {\textasciitilde} -0.5 day-1) and of the emission measure of the EUV source. The total energy emitted in the 1-2000 Å range during the first 12 hours or so of the flaring event was 3 × 1035 ergs. Solar analogs of processes providing similar long-duration soft X-ray radiation are discussed: (1) a coronal mass ejection (CME); (2) a system of giant postflare arches, which can form in powerful solar flares after a CME; (3) typical soft X-ray flaring loops. A general expression describing the energy balance in the EUV source is derived for both CMEs and giant arch systems. As a result, we conclude that the long-duration EUV emission in the AU Mic flare most resembles the solar scenario of emission from a system of giant coronal arches forming after a CME. Such a system on AU Mic would have a size of 1-2 stellar radii and would be energized by reconnection in a vertical current sheet. In this picture, a substantial part of the radiative loss is compensated for by additional postflare energy input, in a similar way as is thought to take place in the posteruptive phases of the most powerful solar flares. Apparently, we are faced here with a new kind of surface activity on late-type stars, which is intermediate between impulsive flares on red dwarf stars and the long-duration, powerful events seen on subgiant components of the RS CVn binaries.},

The candidates were identified through the BANYAN Bayesian inference method of Malo et al., which takes into account the position, proper motion, magnitude, color, radial velocity, and parallax (when available) to establish a membership probability. The derived parameters are compared to Dartmouth magnetic evolutionary models and field stars with the goal of constraining the age of our candidates. We find that, in general, low-mass stars in our sample are more luminous and have inflated radii compared to older stars, a trend expected for pre-main-sequence stars. The Dartmouth magnetic evolutionary models show a good fit to observations of field K and M stars, assuming a magnetic field strength of a few kG, as typically observed for cool stars. Using the low-mass members of the β Pictoris moving group, we have re-examined the age inconsistency problem between lithium depletion age and isochronal age (Hertzspring-Russell diagram). We find that the inclusion of the magnetic field in evolutionary models increases the isochronal age estimates for the K5V-M5V stars. Using these models and field strengths, we derive an average isochronal age between 15 and 28 Myr and we confirm a clear lithium depletion boundary from which an age of 26 ± 3 Myr is derived, consistent with previous age estimates based on this method.},

	abstract = {Context: Evidence of magnetic interaction between late-type stars and close-in giant planets is provided by the observations of stellar hot spots rotating synchronously with the planets and showing an enhancement of chromospheric and X-ray fluxes. Possible photospheric signatures of such an interaction have also been reported. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Aims: We investigate star-planet interaction in the framework of a magnetic field model of a stellar corona, considering the interaction between the coronal field and that of a planetary magnetosphere moving through the corona. This is motivated, among other reasons, by the difficulty of accounting for the energy budgets of the interaction phenomena with previous models. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: A linear force-free model is applied to describe the coronal field and study the evolution of its total magnetic energy and relative helicity according to the boundary conditions at the stellar surface and the effects related to the planetary motion through the corona. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: The energy budget of the star-planet interaction is discussed, assuming that the planet may trigger a release of the energy of the coronal field by decreasing its relative helicity. The observed intermittent character of the star-planet interaction is explained by a topological change in the stellar coronal field, induced by a variation in its relative helicity. The model predicts the formation of many prominence-like structures in the case of highly active stars owing to the accumulation of matter evaporated from the planet inside an azimuthal flux rope in the outer corona. Moreover, the model can explain why stars accompanied by close-in planets have a higher X-ray luminosity than those with distant planets. It predicts that the best conditions for detecting radio emission from the exoplanets and their host stars are achieved when the field topology is characterized by field lines connected to the surface of the star, leading to a chromospheric hot spot rotating synchronously with the planet. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: The main predictions of the model can be verified with current observational techniques, by a simultaneous monitoring of the chromospheric flux and X-ray (or radio) emission, and spectropolarimetric observations of the photospheric magnetic fields.},

	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Several studies suggest that the activity level of a planet-host star can be influenced by the presence of a close-by orbiting planet. Moreover, the interaction mechanisms that have been proposed, magnetic interaction and tidal interaction, exhibit a very different dependence on the orbital separation between the star and the planet. A detection of activity enhancement and characterization of its dependence on planetary orbital distance can, in principle, allow us to characterize the physical mechanism behind the activity enhancement. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used the HARPS-N spectrograph to measure the stellar activity level of HD 80606 during the planetary periastron passage and compared the activity measured to that close to apastron. Being characterized by an eccentricity of 0.93 and an orbital period of 111 days, the system's extreme variation in orbital separation makes it a perfect target to test our hypothesis. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find no evidence for a variation in the activity level of the star as a function of planetary orbital distance, as measured by all activity indicators employed: log(R'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}HK{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), H{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}α{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, NaI, and HeI. None of the models employed, whether magnetic interaction or tidal interaction, provides a good description of the data. The photometry revealed no variation either, but it was strongly affected by poor weather conditions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We find no evidence for star-planet interaction in HD 80606 at the moment of the periastron passage of its very eccentric planet. The straightforward explanation for the non-detection is the absence of interaction as a result of a low magnetic field strength on either the planet or the star and of the low level of tidal interaction between the two. However, we cannot exclude two scenarios: I) the interaction can be instantaneous and of magnetic origin, being concentrated on the substellar point and its surrounding area; and II) the interaction can lead to a delayed activity enhancement. In either scenario, a star-planet interaction would not be detectable with the dataset described in this paper.},

We present an experiment to detect flares in space-borne photometric data using deep neural networks. Using a set of artificial data and real photometric data we trained a set of neural networks, and found that the best performing architectures were the recurrent neural networks using long short-term memory layers. The best trained network detected flares over 5σ with ≳80\% recall and precision and was also capable of distinguishing typical false signals (e.g., maxima of RR Lyr stars) from real flares. Testing the network -trained on Kepler data- on TESS light curves showed that the neural net is able to generalize and find flares -with similar effectiveness- in completely new data with different sampling and characteristics from those of the training set ő.},

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

The quiescent profiles of the C IV and Si IV lines are broad, and not simple Gaussians in shape. Flux in the C IV and Si IV lines, for example, can be measured reliably out to about +/- 200 km/s from line center. Each of the C IV and Si IV profiles can be fitted accurately by two Gaussians (one narrow and the other broad) centered on nearly the same wavelength, with the narrower component accounting for roughly 60\% ofthe total integrated flux. The narrow components have similar line widths to those observed in solar active and quiet regions. The broad Gaussian components of the AU Mic line profiles are reminiscent of the broad C IV profiles observed in solar transition region explosive events, which are thought to be associated with emerging magnetic flux regions where field reconnection occurs.},

	abstract = {So far, the Sun is the only isolated main-sequence star detected in gamma-rays, particularly during powerful flares. Young ultracool dwarfs are far more active so they are also plausible gamma-ray sources. We performed a spatial stack of 97 of the nearest X-ray and radio flare stars to search for GeV emission using nearly 12 yr of data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The stacked residual maps showed no significant signal. Modeling the upper limits indicates a peak stellar flux at least a factor of 7 below the noise level. We also analyze the phase-folded light curve of the rapidly rotating radio star TVLM 513-46546, report a tentative (TS = 30) pulsed signal, and refine its period. We examine the possibility of a false-positive signal by analyzing nearby Fermi catalog sources and test fields, and by repeating the analysis using different periods. No other periodic signals are found, despite clear detections of the catalog sources, and the TS value for TVLM 513 increases systematically to the optimal period. The putative gamma-ray signal is nearly in phase with the optical peak, and out of phase with the radio pulses by 0.4 ± 0.05 rotations. These results argue for emission from relativistic protons streaming down flux tubes toward the photospheric active regions. The protons colliding with the atmosphere create neutral pions that decay into gamma-ray photons. This would be the first detection of a normal, isolated star in gamma-rays, and the strongest evidence yet for proton acceleration in stellar magnetospheres.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the results of five years (five runs, 23 nights) of spectropolarimetric observations of active stars with the UCL Echelle Spectrograph of the Anglo-Australian Telescope. 225 circularly (and four linearly) polarized spectra were recorded on 28 objects (21 active stars and seven calibration standards) using the new technique of Zeeman-Doppler imaging. To extract polarization echelle spectra from raw frames, we developed a new dedicated automatic software package (called ESprit, which utilizes optimal extraction techniques) whose detailed description is given in the paper. For each recorded spectrum, we extract `mean' polarized and unpolarized profiles using `least-squares deconvolution', a technique similar to cross-correlation, which can enhance enormously the sensitivity of Zeeman-Doppler imaging, by up to 7.5 mag in flux with respect to a single average line analysis or by 4.5 mag compared with the older technique of Donati et al. in the particular case of a K1 star. Magnetic field is detected unambiguously on 14 objects, namely the weak-line T Tauri star V410 Tau, the pre-main-sequence binary HD 155555, the ZAMS stars AB Dor and LQ Hya, the dwarf flare star CC Eri, the RS CVn systems HR 1099, EI Eri, TY Pyx, CF Tuc, SZ Psc, II Peg, IM Peg and IL Hya, and the FK Com star YY Men. Marginal field detections are also obtained for the weak-line T Tauri star HD 283572 and the Herbig Ae star HD 104237. Except on HR 1099 and II Peg, our results represent the first direct field detections ever reported on these objects, and in particular the first direct field detection on as young a star as V410 Tau. Most of the magnetic signatures we detect on cool stars show several sign reversals throughout the line profile, indicating that the parent field structure is rather complex and must feature (as expected) many small-scale magnetic regions of different polarities. For all stars on which Zeeman detections are recorded with sufficient accuracy (namely LQ Hya, CC Eri, HR 1099, EI Eri, II Peg, IL Hya and YY Men), differential least-squares deconvolution from both the blue and the red parts of the spectral domain indicates that the magnetic regions we detect are mostly 500 to 1000 K cooler than, and sometimes at the same temperature as, but never warmer than the surrounding photosphere. Serendipitous results include the first detection (i) of small-amplitude radial velocity variations (1.3kms{\textasciicircum}-1 peak to peak) of the Herbig Ae star HD 104237 with small enough a period (37.5+/-1 min) that they must be due to stellar pulsations and (ii) of the solar-like secondary component of the RS CVn system IL Hya.},

	abstract = {The discovery of exoplanets orbiting red dwarfs, such as Proxima Centauri b, has led to questions of their habitability and capacity to retain liquid surface water. While Proxima b is in a “temperate orbit,” I.e., an Earth at that location would not freeze or boil its oceans, its proximity to a parent star with quite high magnetic activity is likely to influence its atmospheric evolution and habitability. Planetary magnetic fields can prevent direct stripping away of the planetary atmosphere by the stellar wind, but ion escape can still occur at the magnetic poles. This process, the polar wind, is well known to occur at Earth and may have contributed to the habitability of Earth’s early atmosphere. The polar wind is highly variable and sensitive to both ionizing radiation and geomagnetic activity. The higher ionizing radiation levels of M dwarfs at habitable zone distances are expected to increase the polar wind by orders of magnitude and, instead of helping create a habitable atmosphere, may strip away enough volatiles to render the planet inhospitable. Here, we compute the ionospheric outflow of an Earth-twin subject to the enhanced stellar EUV flux of Proxima b, and the effect on atmospheric escape timescales. We show that an Earth-like planet would not survive the escape of its atmosphere at that location, and therefore the pathway to habitability for Proxima b requires a very different atmospheric history than that of Earth.},

	abstract = {We study the magnetospheric structure and the ionospheric Joule Heating of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars in the habitable zone using a set of magnetohydrodynamic models. The stellar wind solution is used to drive a model for the planetary magnetosphere, which is coupled with a model for the planetary ionosphere. Our simulations reveal that the space environment around close-in habitable planets is extreme, and the stellar wind plasma conditions change from sub- to super-Alfvénic along the planetary orbit. As a result, the magnetospheric structure changes dramatically with a bow shock forming in the super-Alfvénic sectors, while no bow shock forms in the sub-Alfvénic sectors. The planets reside most of the time in the sub-Alfvénic sectors with poor atmospheric protection. A significant amount of Joule Heating is provided at the top of the atmosphere as a result of the intense stellar wind. For the steady-state solution, the heating is about 0.1\%-3\% of the total incoming stellar irradiation, and it is enhanced by 50\% for the time-dependent case. The significant Joule Heating obtained here should be considered in models for the atmospheres of habitable planets in terms of the thickness of the atmosphere, the top-side temperature and density, the boundary conditions for the atmospheric pressure, and particle radiation and transport. Here we assume constant ionospheric Pedersen conductance similar to that of the Earth. The conductance could be greater due to the intense EUV radiation leading to smaller heating rates. We plan to quantify the ionospheric conductance in future study.},

The flare had an energy of 3.2± {\textasciicircum}\{0.4\}\_\{0.3\}× 10{\textasciicircum}\{36\} erg and a fractional amplitude of 7.2 ± 0.8, making it one of the most energetic flares seen on an M star. The star is also X-ray active, in the saturated regime with log LX/LBol = -3.1. In the flare's peak, we have identified multimode quasi-periodic pulsations formed of two statistically significant periods of approximately 320 and 660 s. This flare is one of the largest amplitude events to exhibit such pulsations. The shorter period mode is observed to start after a short-lived spike in flux lasting around 30 s, which would not have been resolved in Kepler or TESS short-cadence modes. Our data show how the high cadence of the Next Generation Transient Survey (NGTS) can be used to apply solar techniques to stellar flares and to identify potential causes of the observed oscillations. We also discuss the implications of this flare for the habitability of planets around M star hosts and how NGTS can help our understanding of this.},

In this article, we review the observational and modelling achievements since the previous review on this topic by Nakariakov and Melnikov ( Space Sci. Rev. 149, 119, 2009). In recent years, it has become clear that QPPs are an inherent feature of solar flares because almost all flares exhibit QPPs. Moreover, it is now firmly established that QPPs often show multiple periods. We also review possible mechanisms for generating QPPs. Up to now, it has not been possible to conclusively identify the triggering mechanism or cause of QPPs. The lack of this identification currently hampers possible seismological inferences of flare plasma parameters. QPPs in stellar flares have been detected for a long time, and the high-quality data of the Kepler mission allows studying the QPP more systematically. However, it has not been conclusively shown whether the timescales of stellar QPPs are different or the same as those in solar flares.},

In this paper, we perform MHD numerical simulations of magnetic reconnection, where the effect of five-minute solar p-mode oscillations is examined. UV emission lines are synthesised on the basis of numerical results in order to compare with observations directly. It is found that several typical and puzzling features of the TREEs with impulsive bursty behaviour can only be explained if there exist p-mode oscillations and the reconnection site is located in the upper chromosphere at a height range of around 1900 km {\textless} h {\textless} 2150 km above the solar surface. Furthermore, the lack of proper motions of the high-velocity ejection may be due to a rapid change of temperature along the reconnection ejecta.},

The specific physical mechanisms responsible for generating those emissions are not well understood, but in general the spot seems to arise because of an electromagnetic interaction between Jupiter's magnetic field and the plasma surrounding Io, driving currents of around 1 million amperes down through Jupiter's ionosphere. The other galilean satellites may also leave footprints, and the presence or absence of such footprints should illuminate the underlying physical mechanism by revealing the strengths of the currents linking the satellites to Jupiter. Here we report persistent, faint, far-ultraviolet emission from the jovian footprints of Ganymede and Europa. We also show that Io's magnetic footprint extends well beyond the immediate vicinity of Io's flux-tube interaction with Jupiter, and much farther than predicted theoretically; the emission persists for several hours downstream. We infer from these data that Ganymede and Europa have persistent interactions with Jupiter's magnetic field despite their thin atmospheres.},

	abstract = {In an examination of the Solwind coronagraph images obtained during the interval March 28, 1979, to December 31, 1981, we have identified 998 coronal mass ejections and recorded their structural classes, central latitudes, latitudinal spans, speeds, excess brightnesses, and relative importances. A statistical analysis revealed the following general results. (1) The properties of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) depended strongly on their structure. Curved front, halo, and complex CMEs were the most energetic, and single spike, streamer blowout, and diffuse fan CMEs were the least energetic. CMEs occurred over a wide range of position angles, broadly centered on the equator, and had an average angular span of 45°. The leading edge moved at an average of approximately 470 km/s, and the average ejected mass and kinetic energy were 4.1×1015 g and 3.5×1030 erg, respectively. The average CME proton flux at the equator at 1 AU was 2.2×107 cm-2 s-1 or approximately 5\% of the measured in situ flux during 1971-1976. (2) During 1979-1981, the average occurrence rate was 1.8/day for all CMEs, 0.9/day for ``major'' CMEs, and 0.15/day for all CMEs that crossed the equator and had an angular span of at least 45°. (3) The temporal variations in the CME occurrence rate did not show an obvious persistent relation to the variations in the sunspot number on time scales ranging from 7 to 180 days. During 1979-1981 the maximum in the 180-day average CME rate peaked in the second half of 1980, whereas the 180-day average sunspot number peaked during the firt half of 1980. The 180-day average rate of fast CMEs (speeds of at least 800 km/s) had a monotonic increase that seemed to be more closely associated with the occurrence rate of large solar flares than with the variation of the sunspot number.},

If the wide CME had not been observed, the storm would not have been forecast. Thus this case represents an extreme example of so-called “problem” magnetic storms that lack obvious surface signatures of eruptive solar activity. It supports the view that CMEs involve the destabilization of large-scale coronal structures which may or may not have associated surface activity, and that CMEs, not the surface activity, are the key causal link between solar eruptions and space weather at Earth.},

	abstract = {Giant planets have now been discovered around other stars, and it is only a matter of time until Earth-sized planets are detected. Whether any of these planets are suitable for life depends on their volatile abundances, especially water, and on their climates. Only planets within the liquid-water habitable zone (HZ) can support life on their surfaces and, thus, can be analyzed remotely to determine whether they are inhabited. Fortunately, current models predict that HZs are relatively wide around main-sequence stars not too different from our sun. This conclusion is based on studies of how our own planet has evolved over time. Earth's climate has remained conducive to life for the past 3.5 billion years or more, despite a large increase in solar luminosity, probably because of previous higher concentrations of CO{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and/or CH{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}4{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}.

	abstract = {The elemental and isotopic compositions of noble gases trapped in primitive meteorites have the potential to yield stringent constraints on the origin of matter in the solar system. The isotopic compositions of key elements like O, Ti, Ru, Mo suggest that the Earth accreted from material having similarities with two classes of meteorites, carbonaceous chondrites (CC) and non‑carbonaceous chondrites (NC), in particular enstatite chondrites (EC). In this contribution, I examine published noble gas (neon and argon) data for CI-CM as representative of CCs, and ECs as representative of NC terrestrial building blocks. Data were corrected for contributions of cosmic ray-produced isotopes in order to identify the trapped component compositions. For both CCs and ECs, corrected noble gas data indicate that high temperature objects such as chondrules were evolving in a dusty environment. The dust consisted of refractory phases including nanodiamonds, impacts-related debris, medium to low temperature phases mainly made of organics and, in the case of CC, hydrated minerals and icy grains. Remnants of such a dust are found as rims around chondrules and as a matrix between high temperature assemblages. The dust was probably the main source of volatiles on Earth.
In terrestrial reservoirs, covariations of 20Ne/22Ne ratios with 36Ar/22Ne ratios are consistent with mixing between a solar-like neon component trapped in the mantle and a chondritic Ne–Ar component mainly present in the atmosphere and hydrosphere. The chondritic end-member is clearly of the CC type and excludes EC-like material as the source of atmospheric volatiles. In addition to CC-like material, the isotopic composition of heavy noble gases (Kr and Xe) in the atmosphere points to a {\textasciitilde} 20\% contribution of cometary material akin of the composition of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. In contrast, comets might have contributed less than 1\% terrestrial water, C and N. Solar-like neon in the terrestrial mantle might have originated from solar irradiation of free-floating dust before parent body compaction, but this would require a cleared, dust-free environment. Trapping of nebular gas into forming solids during the gas epoch of the nascent solar system appears a more promising possibility. For other mantle volatiles, the stable isotopes of H, N, Ar, Kr and Xe point to a chondritic origin. The hydrogen and nitrogen isotopic signatures of mantle rocks and minerals are consistent with an EC-like contribution whereas those of heavy noble gases are still too imprecise to conclude. Further progress in the field will require high precision analysis of noble gases (in particular, Kr and Xe) trapped in the terrestrial (and martian) mantle(s), as well as documenting the composition of the Venusian atmosphere.
We investigated mantle noble gas abundance ratios using a global compilation of data from mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) and high 3He/4He ocean island basalts (OIB), coupled with calculated abundances based on closed-system evolution models. Assuming that the mantle sources of MORB and high 3He/4He OIB are derived from the same early Earth parental material, variations in their noble gas abundance ratios are useful to ascertain which source is more depleted or degassed, or if the mantle noble gases might be a hybrid of different parental materials. Therefore, noble gas compositions of mantle sources can be a key to elucidating mantle evolution and structure. We calculated the noble gas abundance patterns using a Monte Carlo approach with validated end-members, which provides new estimates for the abundance ratios and their uncertainties. The adequacy of the calculated values was confirmed by existing data. We compiled all published noble gas data extracted by total heating of glassy oceanic basalts, which enables estimation of the pristine abundance patterns of noble gases including Kr for both sources of MORB and OIB. The pristine abundance ratios of the mantle sources for oceanic basalts are estimated by correcting measured values for atmospheric influences and elemental fractionation. The corrected abundance ratios resemble mantle values calculated using the proposed end-members for MORB and high 3He/4He OIB. The estimated relative abundance ratios in the high 3He/4He OIB source are similar to those of C1 chondrites in the range of He to Kr, supporting the hypothesis that a less degassed primitive OIB source can exist in the Earth's mantle. By contrast, the MORB source shows depletion of lighter noble gases, but with high relative helium content compared to the OIB source. The contrast in He/Ne abundance ratios between MORB and OIB, is a key constraint on mantle evolution models, andis expected to reflect several stages of diffusive fractionation during Earth history, or different initial mantle sources, which would require heterogeneous Earth accretion.
Plate tectonics is thought to be a major driver of volatile redistribution on Earth. The budget of nitrogen in Earth's mantle has been suggested to be almost entirely surface-derived. Recycling would contribute nitrogen with relatively heavy 15N/14N isotope ratios to Earth's mantle. This could explain why the Earth's mantle 15N/14N isotope ratio is substantially higher than both solar gases and chondritic parent bodies akin to enstatite chondrites. Here, published nitrogen isotope data of mid-ocean ridge and ocean island basalts are compiled and used to evaluate the nitrogen subduction hypothesis. Nitrogen isotope ratios are used in conjunction with published N2/3He and K2O/TiO2 ratios on the same basalts. Assuming that 3He is not recycled, N2/3He ratios are argued to trace nitrogen addition to mantle sources via subduction. Various mantle source enrichments for basalts are tracked with K2O/TiO2 ratios: elevated K2O/TiO2 ratios are assumed to primarily reflect the contributions of recycled components in the basalts mantle sources. The main result of our data compilation is that for most basalts, δ15N and N2/3He remain constant across a vast range of K2O/TiO2 ratios. Mid-ocean ridge basalts have δ15N signatures that are lower than air by {\textasciitilde}4‰ and an average N2/3He ratio of 3.7 (±1.2) x106 (95\% confidence, n = 30). Published δ15N and N2/3He are invariant across K2O/TiO2 ratios that vary over a factor of {\textasciitilde}20. Using estimates of slab K2O/TiO2 and [TiO2], the observed invariant δ15N and N2/3He may be fit with slabs containing {\textasciitilde}0.1 ppm N. A mass balance shows that adding {\textasciitilde}10\% recycled slabs to the convective mantle only raises the N2/3He by {\textless}5\%. Lavas from Iceland, Galapagos and Hawaii have high 3He/4He and 15N/14N ratios relative to the convective mantle. Only seven samples show nitrogen isotopic signatures that are unaffected by air contamination, although those samples are poorly characterized for N2/3He. The seven basalts show δ15N between −2 and 0‰ that do not vary systematically with K2O/TiO2 ratios that vary over a factor of {\textasciitilde}5. The N2/3He ratios of these seven basalts is unknown, but the high 3He/4He mantle may be estimated by combining published N2/36Ar to 3He/36Ar ratios. This yields a N2/3He of 2.3 (±1.2) x 106 (1σ uncertainty). This is indistinguishable from the MORB estimate of 3.7 (±1.2) x 106. Invariant δ15N across variable degrees of mantle enrichments and MORB-like N2/3He for the high 3He/4He mantle are not consistent with nitrogen addition to plume sources with elevated 3He/4He ratios. A δ15N between −2 and 0‰ for plume sources, only marginally higher than MORB, could be a primordial feature of undegassed mantle reservoirs. Nonetheless, nitrogen subduction may have contributed to a specific array of mantle sources, as revealed by the few published data on basalts with low 3He/4He ratios. Lavas from the Society plume with low 3He/4He ratios show an enriched mantle source, and they have elevated δ15N ≥ +0.5‰ and N2/3He {\textgreater} 107. For those, the addition of slabs with concentrations of {\textasciitilde}0.1 ppm N to a mantle source can account for the integrated dataset. To summarize, the published data suggest that nitrogen subduction may explain a sub-set of published N isotope data on basalts, but that N recycling has an overall more limited impact on mantle nitrogen than previously thought.
We have performed a comprehensive noble gas study, including the isotopes of krypton and xenon, on a set of micrometeorites (MMs) collected from surface snow at Dome C (DC) on the Antarctic plateau. He and Ne are generally dominated by a solar component, with lower 4He concentrations and 4He/20Ne ratios in crystalline (Xtal) compared to fine-grained carbonaceous (FgC) MMs. Concentrations of (surface-correlated) solar wind (SW) He and Ne in FgC MMs are at the high end of what has been seen in earlier work, whereas the abundances of (volume-correlated) Kr and Xe are similar to what has been found in previous studies of MMs. In most samples, isotopic ratios for Kr and Xe are in the usual range of Q-Kr and -Xe (the Q component is the dominating component in primitive macroscopic meteorites) and air. When quantifiable, cosmic ray exposure (CRE) ages based on cosmogenic 21Ne and 3He, in combination with the Poynting-Robertson effect, are broadly consistent with an origin of the MMs from the asteroid belt. An exception is an Xtal MM, which exhibits a cosmogenic 21Ne concentration in agreement with an origin from beyond Saturn, consistent with a possible cometary origin. In addition, data for trapped noble gases in three (out of ten analyzed) DC MMs provide hints that these may be related to a cometary source. One sample, a fragment of a FgC MM, is of particular interest. This fragment exhibits a Xe composition, although with large analytical uncertainties, deficient in the heavy isotopes 134Xe and 136Xe. This is similar to the Xe isotopic pattern, probably related to cometary ice, measured by Rosetta in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The same MM also has an unusually high 36Ar/38Ar ratio, consistent with Rosetta's Ar measurement (in this case the latter having a large uncertainty). The other hints are for two MMs, of crystalline (Xtal) type, that show Ne similar to that found in laboratory analysis of refractory grains captured from comet 81P/Wild 2 by the Stardust mission. Additionally, a FgC/Xtal MM may contain excess 3He, similar to what has been seen in some cluster interplanetary dust particles (cluster IDPs).
Noble gas isotopes in plume-influenced oceanic-island basalts (OIBs) clearly indicate the existence of distinct reservoirs somewhere in the deep Earth that are characterized by their more primitive noble gas isotopic signatures. As one of the largest differentiated layers on Earth, whether the Earth’s liquid outer core can preserve ‘primordial’ noble gases is fundamental for better understanding the Earth’s formation and the mantle evolution. Since Earth’s core is believed to have formed via liquid iron segregated from magma ocean during the planetary accretion stage, how much noble gases could have been incorporated into Earth’s core depends on the partitioning of noble gases between liquid metal and molten silicates. In this study, we perform thermodynamic integration (TI) calculations based on first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulation to investigate the partition coefficients of noble gases (NG: He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) between liquid Fe and MgSiO3 melt. The simulations have been performed by adopting conditions that the pressures are from 10 ∼ 135 GPa and the temperatures from 2300 ∼ 5000 K to fully account for possible core-mantle equilibrium conditions. By analyzing the temperature and pressure dependence of the results, we suggest that the metal-silicate partitioning of noble gases (DNG) merely depends on the temperature, with extremely low DNG {\textless} 0.001 at temperatures {\textless} 2500 K (20 GPa), but increases to different degrees at high temperatures. The DNG tends to be more affected by temperature as the noble gas atomic mass increases, with the least temperature effect on the partition coefficient of He (DHe), which increases from ∼ 10−3 at 2300 K (10 GPa) to ∼ 10−1 (5000 K, 135 GPa) near the core-mantle boundary (CMB), and DNe = 10−6 ∼ 10−3, DAr = 10−6 ∼ 10−2, DKr = 10−7 ∼ 10−1 and DXe = 10−5 ∼ 100 from 2300 to 5000 K, respectively. Analysis of electronic interactions indicates that noble gases have positive chemical bonding with Fe, Mg, and Si atoms, and the bonding strengths increase with pressure as well as increasing noble gas atomic mass. Based on our calculated partition coefficients, we suggest that Earth’s core may have preserved significant amounts of noble gases considering the volatile-rich environment from which the core segregated.
Trapped, paleoatmospheric xenon (Xe) in the Martian regolith breccia NWA 11220 is mass-dependently fractionated relative to solar Xe by 16.2 ± 2.7‰/amu. These data indicate that fractionation of atmospheric Xe persisted for hundreds of millions of years after planetary formation. Such a protracted duration of atmospheric Xe mass fractionation, which is particularly striking when compared to the non-fractionated state of Martian atmospheric krypton (Kr), cannot be easily reconciled with Xe escape as a neutral atom in a neutral hydrodynamic hydrogen wind. However, Xe escape as an ion coupled to a partially ionized hydrogen or oxygen wind provides a simple solution to problems associated with the neutral escape hypothesis. Ionic Xe escape requires a sufficiently high escape flux of a carrier ion (H+ or O+) and probably requires a structured planetary magnetic field to channel the flow. The end of Xe escape from Mars could be attributed to waning hydrogen sources from volcanic outgassing or from interactions of reduced impactors with surface water and ice. Alternatively, if Xe ions were driven off by O+, the end of Xe escape could be attributed to the decay of solar extreme ultra-violet radiation.},

Many authors have proposed mechanisms by which Mars could have lost (or sequestered) an earlier, thicker atmosphere but none of these proposals has gained general acceptance. Here we examine the process of atmospheric erosion by impacts and show that it may account for an early episode of atmosphere loss from Mars. On the basis of this model, the primordial atmospheric pressure on Mars must have been in the vicinity of 1 bar, barring other sources or sinks of CO2. Current impact fluxes are too small to erode significantly the present martian atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The health risks of space radiation are arguably the most serious challenge to space exploration, possibly preventing these missions due to safety concerns or increasing their costs to amounts beyond what would be acceptable. Radiation in space is substantially different from Earth: high-energy (E) and charge (Z) particles (HZE) provide the main contribution to the equivalent dose in deep space, whereas γ rays and low-energy α particles are major contributors on Earth. This difference causes a high uncertainty on the estimated radiation health risk (including cancer and noncancer effects), and makes protection extremely difficult. In fact, shielding is very difficult in space: the very high energy of the cosmic rays and the severe mass constraints in spaceflight represent a serious hindrance to effective shielding. Here the physical basis of space radiation protection is described, including the most recent achievements in space radiation transport codes and shielding approaches. Although deterministic and Monte Carlo transport codes can now describe well the interaction of cosmic rays with matter, more accurate double-differential nuclear cross sections are needed to improve the codes. Energy deposition in biological molecules and related effects should also be developed to achieve accurate risk models for long-term exploratory missions. Passive shielding can be effective for solar particle events; however, it is limited for galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Active shielding would have to overcome challenging technical hurdles to protect against GCR. Thus, improved risk assessment and genetic and biomedical approaches are a more likely solution to GCR radiation protection issues.},

Stellar CME parameters, such as mass and velocity, have yet not been determined statistically. So far only a handful of stellar CMEs has been detected mainly on dMe stars using spectroscopic observations. We therefore aim for a statistical determination of CMEs of solar-like stars by using spectroscopic data from the ESO phase 3 and Polarbase archives. To identify stellar CMEs, we use the Doppler signal in optical spectral lines being a signature of erupting filaments that are closely correlated to CMEs. We investigate more than 3700 h of on-source time of in total 425 dF-dK stars. We find no signatures of CMEs and only few flares. To explain this low level of activity, we derive upper limits for the non-detections of CMEs and compare those with empirically modelled CME rates. To explain the low number of detected flares, we adapt a flare power law derived from EUV data to the H α regime, yielding more realistic results for H α observations. In addition, we examine the detectability of flares from the stars by extracting Sun-as-a-star H α light curves. The extrapolated maximum numbers of observable CMEs are below the observationally determined upper limits, which indicates that the on-source times were mostly too short to detect stellar CMEs in H α. We conclude that these non-detections are related to observational biases in conjunction with a low level of activity of the investigated dF-dK stars.},

Since these stars have dynamo-driven magnetic fields, this implies a strong evolution of their magnetic properties over this time period. The spin-down of these stars is controlled by interactions between stellar and magnetic fields, thus magnetic evolution in turn plays an important role in rotational evolution. We present here the second part of a study investigating the evolution of large-scale surface magnetic fields in this critical time period. We observed stars in open clusters and stellar associations with known ages between 120 and 650 Myr, and used spectropolarimetry and Zeeman Doppler Imaging to characterize their large-scale magnetic field strength and geometry. We report 15 stars with magnetic detections here. These stars have masses from 0.8 to 0.95 M⊙, rotation periods from 0.326 to 10.6 d, and we find large-scale magnetic field strengths from 8.5 to 195 G with a wide range of geometries. We find a clear trend towards decreasing magnetic field strength with age, and a power law decrease in magnetic field strength with Rossby number. There is some tentative evidence for saturation of the large-scale magnetic field strength at Rossby numbers below 0.1, although the saturation point is not yet well defined. Comparing to younger classical T Tauri stars, we support the hypothesis that differences in internal structure produce large differences in observed magnetic fields, however for weak-lined T Tauri stars this is less clear.},

	abstract = {Magnetic activity and rotation are known to be intimately linked for low-mass stars. Understanding rotation evolution over the stellar lifetime is therefore an important goal within stellar astrophysics. In recent years, there has been increased focus on how the complexity of the stellar magnetic field affects the rate of angular-momentum loss from a star. This is a topic that Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI), a technique that is capable of reconstructing the large-scale magnetic field topology of a star, can uniquely address. Using a potential field source surface model, we estimate the open flux, mass-loss rate and angular-momentum-loss rates for a sample of 66 stars that have been mapped with ZDI. We show that the open flux of a star is predominantly determined by the dipolar component of its magnetic field for our choice of source surface radius. We also show that, on the main sequence, the open flux, mass-loss and angular-momentum-loss rates increase with decreasing Rossby number. The exception to this rule is stars less massive than 0.3 M⊙. Previous work suggests that low-mass M dwarfs may possess either strong, ordered and dipolar fields or weak and complex fields. This range of field strengths results in a large spread of angular-momentum-loss rates for these stars and has important consequences for their spin-down behaviour. Additionally, our models do not predict a transition in the mass-loss rates at the so-called wind-dividing line noted from Lyα studies.},

In this paper, we examine the toroidal fields of a sample of 55 stars with magnetic maps, with masses in the range 0.1-1.5 M⊙. We find that the energy contained in toroidal fields has a power-law dependence on the energy contained in poloidal fields. However the power index is not constant across our sample, with stars less and more massive than 0.5 M⊙ having power indices of 0.72 ± 0.08 and 1.25 ± 0.06, respectively. There is some evidence that these two power laws correspond to stars in the saturated and unsaturated regimes of the rotation-activity relation. Additionally, our sample shows that strong toroidal fields must be generated axisymmetrically. The latitudes at which these bands appear depend on the stellar rotation period with fast rotators displaying higher latitude bands than slow rotators.

We observed a weak rotation-activity relation for stars with rotation periods less than about 12 d; for slower rotators, the relation is dominated by scatter. However, we are able to state that the solar activity level derived from Virgo data is consistent with the majority of stars with similar rotation periods in our sample. Finally, our KOI sample is consistently approximately 0.3 dex more variable than our non-KOIs; we ascribe the difference to a selection effect due to low orbital obliquity in the planet-hosting stars and derive a mean obliquity for our sample of χ = 6+5°-6, similar to that seen in the solar system.},

	abstract = {A fraction of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs are known to be radio active, in some cases producing periodic pulses. Extensive studies of two such objects have also revealed optical periodic variability, and the nature of this variability remains unclear. Here, we report on multi-epoch optical photometric monitoring of six radio-detected dwarfs, spanning the {\textasciitilde}M8-L3.5 spectral range, conducted to investigate the ubiquity of periodic optical variability in radio-detected ultracool dwarfs. This survey is the most sensitive ground-based study carried out to date in search of periodic optical variability from late-type dwarfs, where we obtained 250 hr of monitoring, delivering photometric precision as low as {\textasciitilde}0.15\%. Five of the six targets exhibit clear periodicity, in all cases likely associated with the rotation period of the dwarf, with a marginal detection found for the sixth. Our data points to a likely association between radio and optical periodic variability in late-M/early-L dwarfs, although the underlying physical cause of this correlation remains unclear. In one case, we have multiple epochs of monitoring of the archetype of pulsing radio dwarfs, the M9 TVLM 513-46546, spanning a period of 5 yr, which is sufficiently stable in phase to allow us to establish a period of 1.95958 ± 0.00005 hr. This phase stability may be associated with a large-scale stable magnetic field, further strengthening the correlation between radio activity and periodic optical variability. Finally, we find a tentative spin-orbit alignment of one component of the very low mass binary, LP 349-25.},

We detect H I Lyα absorption from the interaction region between the stellar wind and interstellar medium, i.e., the stellar astrosphere. With the assistance of hydrodynamic models of the π1 UMa astrosphere, we infer a wind only half as strong as the solar wind for this star. This suggests that the Sun and solar-like stars do not have particularly strong coronal winds in their youth.

Close-in exoplanets are conveniently positioned in the inner regions of stellar winds and can, thus, be used to probe the otherwise-unobservable local properties of their host-stars' winds. Here, we use local stellar wind characteristics observationally derived in the studies of atmospheric evaporation of the warm-neptune GJ 436b to derive the global characteristics of the wind of its M-dwarf host. Using an isothermal wind model, we constrain the stellar wind temperature to be in the range (0.36-0.43) MK, with {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}=(0.5-2.5) × 10{\textasciicircum}\{-15\} M\_\{⊙\} yr{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}. By computing the pressure balance between the stellar wind and the interstellar medium, we derive the size of the astrophere of GJ 436 to be around 25 au, significantly more compact than the heliosphere. We demonstrate in this paper that transmission spectroscopy, coupled to planetary atmospheric evaporation and stellar wind models, can be a useful tool for constraining the large-scale wind structure of planet-hosting stars. Extending our approach to future planetary systems discoveries will open new perspectives for the combined characterization of planetary exospheres and winds of cool dwarf stars.},

Applying least-squares convolution and maximum entropy image reconstruction techniques to our sets of spectra, we demonstrate that this star features on its surface a large cool polar cap with several appendages extending to lower latitudes, as well as one spot close to the equator. The images reconstructed at both epochs are in good overall agreement, except for a photospheric shear that we interpret in terms of latitudinal differential rotation. Given the spot distribution at the epoch of our observations, differential rotation could only be investigated between latitudes 15° and 60°. We find in particular that the observed differential rotation is compatible with a solar-like law (i.e., with rotation rate decreasing towards high latitudes proportionally to sin2l, where l denotes the latitude) in this particular latitude range. Assuming that such a law can be extrapolated to all latitudes, we find that the equator of RX J1508.6-4423 does one more rotational cycle than the pole every 50+/-10d, implying a photospheric shear 2 to 3 times stronger than that of the Sun. We also discover that the Hα emission profile of RX J1508.6-4423 is most of the time double-peaked and strongly modulated with the rotation period of the star. We interpret this rotationally modulated emission as being caused by a dense and complex prominence system, the circumstellar distribution of which is obtained through maximum entropy Doppler tomography. These maps show in particular that prominences form a complete and inhomogeneous ring around the star, precisely at the corotation radius. We use the total Hα and Hβ emission flux to estimate that the mass of the whole prominence system is about 1020g. From our observation that the whole cloud system surrounding the star is regenerated in less than 4d, we conclude that the braking time-scale of RX J1508.6-4423 is shorter than 1Gyr, and that prominence expulsion is thus likely to contribute significantly to the rotational spindown of young low-mass stars.},

	abstract = {Mass-loss rates for the tenuous, hot winds of cool stars are extremely difficult to measure, yet they are a crucial ingredient in the stars' rotational evolution. We present a new method for measuring these mass-loss rates in young, rapidly rotating stars. These stars are known to support systems of `slingshot prominences' fed by hot wind material flowing up from the stellar surface into the summits of closed magnetic loop structures. The material gathers and cools near the co-rotation radius until its density becomes large enough that it is visible as a transient absorption feature in the hydrogen Balmer lines and strong resonance lines such as Ca II H \& K. Here we present the key insight that the sonic point usually lies well below the condensation region. The flow at the wind base is therefore unaffected by the presence of an overlying prominence, so we can use the observed masses and recurrence times of the condensations to estimate the mass flux in the wind. These measurements extend the relationship between mass-loss rate per unit surface area and X-ray flux to span 5 orders of magnitude. They demonstrate no evidence of the suspected weakening of stellar mass-loss rates at high X-ray flux levels.},

	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We revisit the X-ray properties of the main sequence Hyades members and the relation between X-ray emission and stellar rotation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: As an input catalog for Hyades members, we combined three recent Hyades membership lists derived from Gaia DR2 data that include the Hyades core and its tidal tails. We searched for X-ray detections of the main sequence Hyades members in the ROSAT all-sky survey, and pointings from ROSAT, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and XMM-Newton. Furthermore, we adopted rotation periods derived from Kepler's K2 mission and other resources. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find an X-ray detection for 281 of 1066 bona fide main sequence Hyades members and provide statistical upper limits for the undetected sources. The majority of the X-ray detected stars are located in the Hyades core because of its generally smaller distance to the Sun. F- and G-type stars have the highest detection fraction (72\%), while K- and M-type dwarfs have lower detection rates (22\%). The X-ray luminosities of the detected members range from ∼2 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}27{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for late M-type dwarfs to ∼2 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}30{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for active binaries. The X-ray luminosity distribution functions formally differ for the members in the core and tidal tails, which is likely caused by a larger fraction of field stars in our Hyades tails sample. Compared to previous studies, our sample is slightly fainter in X-rays due to differences in the Hyades membership list used; furthermore, we extend the X-ray luminosity distribution to fainter luminosities. The X-ray activity of F- and G-type stars is well defined at F{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}X{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/F{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}bol{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≈ 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. The fractional X-ray luminosity and its spread increases to later spectral types reaching the saturation limit (F{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}X{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/F{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}bol{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≈ 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) for members later than spectral type M3. Confirming previous results, the X-ray flux varies by less than a factor of three between epochs for the 104 Hyades members with multiple epoch data, significantly less than expected from solar-like activity cycles. Rotation periods are found for 204 Hyades members, with about half of them being detected in X-rays. The activity-rotation relation derived for the coeval Hyades members has properties very similar to those obtained by other authors investigating stars of different ages. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Data are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/640/A66"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/640/A66{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

We supplement past membership catalogs with candidates selected with updated photometric and proper-motion criteria, generating a list of 258 members, a {\textgreater}50\% increase over previous catalogs. Using a Bayesian framework to fit MESA Isochrones \& Stellar Tracks evolutionary models to literature photometry and the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution data available for 59 cluster members, we infer the age of and distance to NGC 752: 1.34 ± 0.06 Gyr and \{438\}-6+8 pc. We also report the results of our optical monitoring of the cluster using the Palomar Transient Factory. We obtain rotation periods for 12 K and M cluster members, the first periods measured for such low-mass stars with a well-constrained age {\textgreater}1 Gyr. We compare these new periods to data from the younger clusters Praesepe and NGC 6811, and to a theoretical model for angular momentum loss, to examine stellar spin-down for low-mass stars over their first 1.3 Gyr. While on average NGC 752 stars are rotating more slowly than their younger counterparts, the difference is not significant. Finally, we use our spectroscopic observations to measure Hα for cluster stars, finding that members earlier than ≈M2 are magnetically inactive, as expected at this age. Forthcoming Gaia data should solidify and extend the membership of NGC 752 to lower masses, thereby increasing its importance for studies of low-mass stars.},

In this sample we identify 85 flaring objects, ranging in spectral type from M4 to L0. We detect 234 flares in this sample, with energies between 1029.2 and 1032.7 erg, using both automated and manual methods. With this work, we present the largest photometric sample of flares on late-M and ultra-cool dwarfs to date. By extending previous M dwarf flare studies into the ultra-cool regime, we find M5-M7 stars are more likely to flare than both earlier, and later, M dwarfs. By performing artificial flare injection-recovery tests we demonstrate that we can detect a significant proportion of flares down to an amplitude of 1 per cent, and we are most sensitive to flares on the coolest stars. Our results reveal an absence of high-energy flares on the reddest dwarfs. To probe the relations between rotation and activity for fully convective stars, we extract rotation periods for fast rotators and lower-bound period estimates of slow rotators. These rotation periods span from 2.2 hours to 65 days, and we find that the proportion of flaring stars increases for the very fastest rotators. Finally, we discuss the impact of our flare sample on planets orbiting ultra-cool stars. As stars become cooler, they flare less frequently; therefore, it is unlikely that planets around the very reddest dwarfs would enter the 'abiogenesis' zone or drive visible-light photosynthesis through flares alone.},

	abstract = {The rapidly rotating cool dwarfs of the Pleiades are rich in lithium relative to their slowly rotating counterparts. Motivated by observations of inflated radii in young, active stars, and by calculations showing that radius inflation inhibits pre-main-sequence (pre-MS) Li destruction, we test whether this pattern could arise from a connection between stellar rotation rate and radius inflation on the pre-MS. We demonstrate that pre-MS radius inflation can efficiently suppress lithium destruction by rotationally induced mixing in evolutionary models, and that the net effect of inflation and rotational mixing is a pattern where rotation correlates with lithium abundance for M* {\textless} M⊙, and anticorrelates with lithium abundance for M* {\textgreater} M⊙, similar to the empirical trend in the Pleiades. Next, we adopt different prescriptions for the dependence of inflation on rotation, and compare their predictions to the Pleiades lithium/rotation pattern. We find that if a connection between rotation and radius inflation exists, then the important qualitative features of this pattern naturally and generically emerge in our models. This is the first consistent physical model to date that explains the Li-rotation correlation in the Pleiades. We discuss plausible mechanisms for inducing this correlation and suggest an observational test using granulation.},

The age of 7.5 ± 1 Myr inferred from the CMD is much younger than that implied by the strong Li depletion seen in the cluster M-dwarfs, and the Li depletion occurs at much redder colours than predicted. The epoch at which a star of a given mass depletes its Li and the surface temperature of that star are both dependent on its radius. We demonstrate that if the low-mass stars have radii ∼10 per cent larger at a given mass and age, then both the CMD and the Li-depletion pattern of the Gamma Velorum cluster are explained at a common age of ≃18-21 Myr. This radius inflation could be produced by some combination of magnetic suppression of convection and extensive cool starspots. Models that incorporate radius inflation suggest that PMS stars, similar to those in the Gamma Velorum cluster, in the range 0.2 {\textless} M/M⊙ {\textless} 0.7, are at least a factor of 2 older and ∼7 per cent cooler than previously thought and that their masses are much larger (by {\textgreater}30 per cent) than inferred from conventional, non-magnetic models in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.

	abstract = {Due to their production sites, as well as to how they are processed and destroyed in stars, the light elements are excellent tools to investigate a number of crucial issues in modern astrophysics: from stellar structure and non-standard processes at work in stellar interiors, to age dating of stars; from pre-main sequence evolution, to the star formation histories of young clusters and associations, to the issue of multiple populations in globular clusters; from Big Bang nucleosynthesis, to the formation and chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way galaxy and its populations, just to cite some examples. In this paper, we focus on lithium, beryllium and boron (LiBeB) and on carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (CNO). LiBeB are rare elements, with negligible abundances with respect to hydrogen; viceversa, CNO are among the most abundant elements in the Universe, after H and He. Pioneering observations of light-element surface abundances in stars started almost 70 years ago and huge progress has been achieved since then. Indeed, whilst, for different reasons, precise measurements of LiBeB and CNO are difficult, even in our Sun, the advent of state-of-the-art ground- and space-based instrumentation has allowed the determination of high-quality abundances in stars of different type and belonging to different Galactic populations, from metal-poor halo stars to young stars in the solar vicinity, from massive stars to cool dwarfs and giants. Noticeably, with the recent advent of large spectroscopic surveys performed with multi-fiber spectrographs, detailed and homogeneous information on the abundances of Li and CNO for statistically significant samples of stars has been acquired, allowing us to obtain new results and insights and, at the same time, opening new questions and challenges. A complete understanding of the light-element patterns and evolution in the Universe has not been still achieved. Perspectives for further progress will open up soon thanks to the new generation instrumentation that is under development and will come on-line in the coming years.},

	abstract = {High-resolution UV spectra of stellar H I Lyα lines from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) provide observational constraints on the winds of coronal main-sequence stars, thanks to an astrospheric absorption signature created by the interaction between the stellar winds and the interstellar medium. We report the results of a new HST survey of M dwarf stars, yielding six new detections of astrospheric absorption. We estimate mass-loss rates for these detections and upper limits for nondetections. These new constraints allow us to characterize the nature of M dwarf winds and their dependence on coronal activity for the first time. For a clear majority of the M dwarfs, we find winds that are weaker than or comparable in strength to that of the Sun, i.e., \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}{\textbackslash}leqslant 1{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ . However, two of the M dwarfs have much stronger winds: YZ CMi (M4 Ve; \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}=30{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ ) and GJ 15AB (M2 V+M3.5 V; \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}=10{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ ). Even these winds are much weaker than expectations if the solar relation between flare energy and coronal mass ejection (CME) mass extended to M dwarfs. Thus, the solar flare/CME relation does not appear to apply to M dwarfs, with important ramifications for the habitability of exoplanets around M dwarfs. There is evidence for some increase in \${\textbackslash}dot\{M\}\$ with coronal activity as quantified by X-ray flux, but with much scatter. One or more other factors must be involved in determining wind strength besides spectral type and coronal activity, with magnetic topology being one clear possibility. * Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

	abstract = {Stellar mass-loss rates are an important input ingredient for stellar evolution models since they determine stellar evolution parameters such as stellar spin-down and increase in stellar luminosity through the lifetime of a star. Due to the lack of direct observations of stellar winds from Sun-like stars stellar X-ray luminosity and stellar level of activity are commonly used as a proxy for estimating stellar mass-loss rates. However, such an intuitive activity - mass-loss rate relation is not well defined. In this paper, I study the mass-loss rate of the Sun as a function of its activity level. I compare in situ solar wind measurements with the solar activity level represented by the solar X-ray flux. I find no clear dependency of the solar mass flux on solar X-ray flux. Instead, the solar mass-loss rate is scattered around an average value of 2 × 10-14 M⊙ yr-1. This independency of the mass-loss rate on level of activity can be explained by the fact that the activity level is governed by the large modulations in the solar close magnetic flux, while the mass-loss rate is governed by the rather constant open magnetic flux. I derive a simple expression for stellar mass-loss rates as a function of the stellar ambient weak magnetic field, the stellar radius, the stellar escape velocity and the average height of the Alfvén surface. This expression predicts stellar mass-loss rates of 10-15 to 10-12 M⊙ yr-1 for Sun-like stars.},

	abstract = {Pevtsov et al. recently showed that the luminosity of solar and stellar X-rays from closed magnetic structures scales nearly linearly with magnetic flux over 12 decades. We show here that the total power available to accelerate the solar wind also scales linearly with magnetic flux, provided that its sources inject a roughly constant energy per particle prior to losses from heat conducted by electrons into radiation. Using a recently developed model of the solar wind energy source and particle source, we calculate the available solar wind power and convert it into an equivalent X-ray luminosity to explore whether the same process that drives solar wind may also power coronal heating. The quantitative results agree remarkably well with the Pevtsov et al. X-ray observations and with GOES X-ray observations over almost two solar cycles from 1985 to 2004. The model for the solar wind energy and particle source relies on the continual reconfiguration of the supergranular network through the emergence of small bipolar or more complex closed magnetic fields. This naturally leads to an energy flux proportional to field strength on large-scale field structures with field strengths larger than the emerging flux. We conclude that the sources of energy for the solar wind and coronal heating are linked, likely through the emergence of new magnetic flux that continually reconfigures large-scale solar magnetic fields and powers and heats the corona.},

	abstract = {Collisions between the winds of solar-like stars and the local interstellar medium result in a population of hot hydrogen gas surrounding these stars. Absorption from this hot H I can be detected in high-resolution Lyα spectra of these stars from the Hubble Space Telescope. The amount of absorption can be used as a diagnostic for the stellar mass-loss rate. We present new mass-loss rate measurements derived in this fashion for four stars (ɛ Eri, 61 Cyg A, 36 Oph AB, and 40 Eri A). Combining these measurements with others, we study how mass loss varies with stellar activity. We find that for the solar-like GK dwarfs, the mass loss per unit surface area is correlated with X-ray surface flux. Fitting a power law to this relation yields M{\textasciitilde}F1.15+/-0.20X. The active M dwarf Proxima Cen and the very active RS CVn system λ And appear to be inconsistent with this relation. Since activity is known to decrease with age, the above power-law relation for solar-like stars suggests that mass loss decreases with time. We infer a power-law relation of M{\textasciitilde}t-2.00+/-0.52. This suggests that the solar wind may have been as much as 1000 times more massive in the distant past, which may have had important ramifications for the history of planetary atmospheres in our solar system, that of Mars in particular.

We cross-reference 6733 CMEs having well-measured masses against 12 050 X-ray flares having position information as determined from their optical counterparts. For a given flare, we search in time for CMEs which occur 10 - 80 minutes afterward, and we further require the flare and CME to occur within ± 45° in position angle on the solar disk. There are 826 CME/flare pairs which fit these criteria. Comparing the flare fluxes with CME masses of these paired events, we find CME mass increases with flare flux, following an approximately log-linear, broken relationship: in the limit of lower flare fluxes, log (CME mass)∝0.68×log (flare flux), and in the limit of higher flare fluxes, log (CME mass)∝0.33×log (flare flux). We show that this broken power-law, and in particular the flatter slope at higher flare fluxes, may be due to an observational bias against CMEs associated with the most energetic flares: halo CMEs. Correcting for this bias yields a single power-law relationship of the form log (CME mass)∝0.70×log (flare flux). This function describes the relationship between CME mass and flare flux over at least 3 dex in flare flux, from ≈ 10-7 - 10-4 W m-2.},

The study includes an evaluation of corrections to the CME rates, which include instrument duty cycles, visibility functions, mass detection thresholds, and geometrical considerations. The main results are as follows: (1) The frequency of occurrence of CMEs tends to track the solar activity cycle in both amplitude and phase; (2) the CME rates from different instruments, when corrected for both duty cycles and visibility functions, are reasonably consistent; (3) considering only longer-term averages, no one class of solar activity is better correlated with CME rate than any other; (4) the ratio of the annualized CME to solar wind mass flux tends to track the solar cycle; and (5) near solar maximum, CMEs can provide a significant fraction (i.e., ≈ 15\%) of the average mass flux to the near-ecliptic solar wind.},

We solved the two-fluid equations numerically using the JOANNA code. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We show that magnetoacoustic waves triggered in the photosphere by localised velocity pulses can steepen into shocks which heat the chromosphere through ion-neutral collisions. Pulses of greater amplitude heat plasma more effectively and generate larger plasma outflows. Rising the altitude at which the pulse is launched results in opposite effects, mainly in local cooling of the chromosphere and slower plasma outflows. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Even a solitary pulse results in a train of waves. These waves can transform into shock waves and release thermal energy, heating the chromosphere significantly. A pulse can drive vertical flows which higher up can result in the origin of the solar wind.},

	abstract = {Rotational shear layers at the boundary between radiative and convective zones, tachoclines, play a key role in the process of magnetic field generation in solar-like stars. We present two sets of global simulations of rotating turbulent convection and dynamo. The first set considers a stellar convective envelope only; the second one, aiming at the formation of a tachocline, also considers the upper part of the radiative zone. Our results indicate that the resulting properties of the mean flows and dynamo, such as the growth rate, saturation energy, and mode, depend on the Rossby number (Ro). For the first set of models either oscillatory (with ∼2 yr period) or steady dynamo solutions are obtained. The models in the second set naturally develop a tachocline, which in turn leads to the generation of a strong mean magnetic field. Since the field is also deposited in the stable deeper layer, its evolutionary timescale is much longer than in the models without a tachocline. Surprisingly, the magnetic field in the upper turbulent convection zone evolves on the same timescale as the deep field. These models result in either an oscillatory dynamo with a ∼30 yr period or a steady dynamo depending on Ro. In terms of the mean-field dynamo coefficients computed using the first-order smoothing approximation, the field evolution in the oscillatory models without a tachocline seems to be consistent with dynamo waves propagating according to the Parker-Yoshimura sign rule. In the models with tachoclines the dynamics is more complex and involves other transport mechanisms as well as tachocline instabilities.},

We rapidly review previous prominent results from numerical simulations, and present for the first time a series of turbulent, global simulations producing regular magnetic cycles whose period varies systematically with the convective envelope parameters (rotation rate, convective luminosity). We find that the fundamentally non-linear character of the dynamo simulated in this work leads the magnetic cycle period to be inversely proportional to the Rossby number.

Observations of the solar surface reveal a magnetic field with a complex, hierarchical structure consisting of widely different scales. Systematic features such as the solar cycle, the butterfly diagram, and Hale's polarity laws point to the existence of a deep-rooted large-scale magnetic field. At the other end of the scale are magnetic elements and small-scale mixed-polarity magnetic fields. In order to explain these phenomena, dynamo theory provides all the necessary ingredients including the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$effect, magnetic field amplification by differential rotation, magnetic pumping, turbulent diffusion, magnetic buoyancy, flux storage, stochastic variations and nonlinear dynamics. Due to advances in helioseismology, observations of stellar magnetic fields and computer capabilities, significant progress has been made in our understanding of these and other aspects such as the role of the tachocline, convective plumes and magnetic helicity conservation. However, remaining uncertainties about the nature of the deep-seated toroidal magnetic field and the \${\textbackslash}alpha\$effect, and the forbidding range of length scales of the magnetic field and the flow have thus far prevented the formulation of a coherent model for the solar dynamo. A preliminary evaluation of the various dynamo models that have been proposed seems to favor a buoyancy-driven or distributed scenario. The viewpoint proposed here is that progress in understanding the solar dynamo and explaining the observations can be achieved only through a combination of approaches including local numerical experiments and global mean-field modeling.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent advances and current debates in modeling the solar cycle as a hydromagnetic dynamo process. Emphasis is placed on (relatively) simple dynamo models that are nonetheless detailed enough to be comparable to solar cycle observations. After a brief overview of the dynamo problem and of key observational constraints, we begin by reviewing the various magnetic field regeneration mechanisms that have been proposed in the solar context. We move on to a presentation and critical discussion of extant solar cycle models based on these mechanisms. We then turn to the origin and consequences of fluctuations in these models, including amplitude and parity modulation, chaotic behavior, intermittency, and predictability. The paper concludes with a discussion of our current state of ignorance regarding various key questions relating to the explanatory framework offered by dynamo models of the solar cycle.},

	abstract = {On the Sun, the rotation periods of individual sunspots not only trace the latitude-dependence of the surface rotation rate, but also provide clues as to the amount of subsurface fluid shear. In this paper we present the first measurements of stellar differential rotation made by tracking the rotation of individual star-spots with sizes comparable to the largest sunspots. To achieve this we re-analyse four sequences of densely sampled, high signal-to-noise ratio echelle spectra of AB Doradus spanning several stellar rotations in 1996 December. Using spectral subtraction, least-squares deconvolution and matched-filter analysis, we demonstrate that it is possible to measure directly the velocity amplitudes and rotation periods of large numbers of individual star-spots at low to intermediate latitude. We derive values for the equatorial rotation rate and the magnitude of the surface differential rotation, both of which are in excellent agreement with those obtained by Donati \&amp; Collier Cameron from cross-correlation of Doppler images derived a year earlier in 1995 December, and with a re-analysis of the 1996 data by the χ2 landscape method. The differences between the rotation rates of individual spots and the fitted differential rotation law are substantially greater than the observational errors. The smaller spots show a greater scatter about the mean relation than the larger ones, which suggests that buffeting by turbulent supergranular flows could be responsible.},

Several indirect techniques, photometric and spectroscopic, have been used to search for departure from rigid rotation for sufficiently fast rotators. Here we investigate the possibility of measuring stellar differential rotation for solar-type stars through asteroseismology. Rotationally split frequencies of global oscillation provide information about rotation at different latitudes depending on the azimuthal order, m, of the mode of pulsation. We present a method to estimate differential rotation based on the realization that the m = ±1 and m = ±2 components of quadrupole oscillations can be observed simultaneously in asteroseismology. Rotational frequency splittings can be inverted to provide an estimate of the difference in stellar angular velocity between the equator and 45° latitude. The precision of the method, assessed through Monte Carlo simulations, depends on the value of the mean rotation and on the inclination angle between the rotation axis and the line of sight.},

	abstract = {The splitting of the frequencies of the global resonant acoustic modes of the Sun by large-scale flows and rotation permits study of the variation of angular velocity Ω with both radius and latitude within the turbulent convection zone and the deeper radiative interior. The nearly uninterrupted Doppler imaging observations, provided by the Solar Oscillations Investigation (SOI) using the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft positioned at the L1 Lagrangian point in continuous sunlight, yield oscillation power spectra with very high signal-to-noise ratios that allow frequency splittings to be determined with exceptional accuracy. This paper reports on joint helioseismic analyses of solar rotation in the convection zone and in the outer part of the radiative core. Inversions have been obtained for a medium-l mode set (involving modes of angular degree l extending to about 250) obtained from the first 144 day interval of SOI-MDI observations in 1996. Drawing inferences about the solar internal rotation from the splitting data is a subtle process. By applying more than one inversion technique to the data, we get some indication of what are the more robust and less robust features of our inversion solutions. Here we have used seven different inversion methods. To test the reliability and sensitivity of these methods, we have performed a set of controlled experiments utilizing artificial data. This gives us some confidence in the inferences we can draw from the real solar data. The inversions of SOI-MDI data have confirmed that the decrease of Ω with latitude seen at the surface extends with little radial variation through much of the convection zone, at the base of which is an adjustment layer, called the tachocline, leading to nearly uniform rotation deeper in the radiative interior. A prominent rotational shearing layer in which Ω increases just below the surface is discernible at low to mid latitudes. Using the new data, we have also been able to study the solar rotation closer to the poles than has been achieved in previous investigations. The data have revealed that the angular velocity is distinctly lower at high latitudes than the values previously extrapolated from measurements at lower latitudes based on surface Doppler observations and helioseismology. Furthermore, we have found some evidence near latitudes of 75° of a submerged polar jet which is rotating more rapidly than its immediate surroundings. Superposed on the relatively smooth latitudinal variation in Ω are alternating zonal bands of slightly faster and slower rotation, each extending some 10° to 15° in latitude. These relatively weak banded flows have been followed by inversion to a depth of about 5\% of the solar radius and appear to coincide with the evolving pattern of ``torsional oscillations'' reported from earlier surface Doppler studies.},

A dynamo model is developed from these ingredients, and applied to the problem of angular momentum transport in stellar interiors. It produces a predominantly horizontal field.

	abstract = {The stability of differential rotation in the radiative zones of stars is investigated. For sufficiently large x/ (x is the thermal diffusivity and the kinematic viscosity),it is shown that a necessary condition for stability in regions of homogeneous chemical composition is that the angular momentum per unit mass be an increasing function of distance from the rotation axis. In cylindrical coordinates (i:', `o,z), this condition is given by a( 2 )/a {\textgreater} 0 and 3 /az = 0, where is the angular velocity. The condition is also a sufficient one when applied to axisymmetric perturbations. The stable thermal stratification which exists in the radiative zone cannot prevent the instability since, in stars, the thermal diffusivity is much greater than the kinematic viscosity. The turbulent diffusion of angnlar momentum, which arises when the stability condition is violated, is so rapid that it would appear to preclude the fast rotation of the Sun's interior which has been proposed by Dicke * In the absence of the instability associated with thermal diffusion, i.e,if x = 0, Dicke's solar model is found to be stable. Another means whereby angular momentum might be brought up from the solar interior is by the mechanism of spin-down associated with the formation of an Ekman boundary layer just below the solar convective envelope. The transport of angular momentum, either by spin-down or by turbulent diffusion, would result in the mixing of material below the convective zone of solar type stars if an external torque were applied to the stellar surface. Thus, the depletion of lithium and beryllium would be an inevitable consequence of the loss of a significant fraction of the star's initial angular momentum.},

Moreover, since 1995, a large number of extrasolar planetary systems have been discovered where planets can orbit very close to their host star. Finally, our own Solar system is the seat of many interactions between the Sun, the planets, and their natural satellites. Therefore, in such astrophysical systems, tidal interactions are one of the key mechanisms that must be studied to understand the celestial bodies' dynamics and evolution. Indeed, tides generate displacements and flows in stellar and planetary interiors. The associated kinetic energy is then dissipated into heat because of internal friction processes. This leads to secular evolution of orbits and of spins with characteristic time-scales that are intrinsically related to the properties of dissipative mechanisms, the latter depending both on the internal structure of the studied bodies and on the tidal frequency. This lecture is thus aimed to recall the basics of the tidal dynamics and to describe the different tidal flows or displacements that can be excited by a perturber, the conversion of their kinetic energy into heat, the related exchanges of angular momentum, and the consequences for astrophysical systems evolution.},

An illustrative application to the case of an F-type main-sequence star hosting a hot Jupiter is presented.

Such prolonged runaway greenhouses can lead to planetary evolution divergent from that of Earth. During this early runaway phase, photolysis of water vapor and hydrogen/oxygen escape to space can lead to the loss of several Earth oceans of water from planets throughout the habitable zone, regardless of whether the escape is energy-limited or diffusion-limited. We find that the amount of water lost scales with the planet mass, since the diffusion-limited hydrogen escape flux is proportional to the planet surface gravity. In addition to undergoing potential desiccation, planets with inefficient oxygen sinks at the surface may build up hundreds to thousands of bars of abiotically produced O\$\_2\$, resulting in potential false positives for life. The amount of O\$\_2\$ that builds up also scales with the planet mass; we find that O\$\_2\$ builds up at a constant rate that is controlled by diffusion: \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 5 bars/Myr on Earth-mass planets and up to \${\textbackslash}sim\$ 25 bars/Myr on super-Earths. As a result, some recently discovered super-Earths in the habitable zone such as GJ 667Cc could have built up as many as 2000 bars of O\$\_2\$ due to the loss of up to 10 Earth oceans of water. The fate of a given planet strongly depends on the extreme ultraviolet flux, the duration of the runaway regime, the initial water content, and the rate at which oxygen is absorbed by the surface. In general, we find that the initial phase of high luminosity may compromise the habitability of many terrestrial planets orbiting low mass stars.},

Recent geological studies have revealed that the Earth experienced global glaciations in its history ("snowball Earth" hypothesis). In the snowball glaciations, liquid water is thought to have existed under the ice shell because of geothermal heat flow from the Earth's interior. Here, by analogy with the snowball glaciations, I discuss the conditions for an extrasolar terrestrial planet which is covered with ice but has an internal ocean for the timescale of planetary evolution owing to geothermal heat flow from the planetary interior. I show that liquid water can exist if the planetary mass and the water abundance are comparable to the Earth, although a planet with a mass {\textless}0.4 M⊕ (M⊕ is the Earth's mass) would not be able to maintain the internal ocean. Liquid water would be absolutely stable for a planet with a mass gsim4 M⊕ (i.e., super-Earth) either on its surface or beneath the ice, irrespective of planetary orbit and luminosity of the central star. Searches for terrestrial planets in extrasolar planetary systems should consider such a "snowball planet," which is a possible type of water-rich terrestrial planet other than an Earth-like "ocean planet."},

	abstract = {We present a framework for studying generic behaviors possible in the interaction between a resource-harvesting technological civilization (an exo-civilization) and the planetary environment in which it evolves. Using methods from dynamical systems theory, we introduce and analyze a suite of simple equations modeling a population which consumes resources for the purpose of running a technological civilization and the feedback those resources drive on the state of the host planet. The feedbacks can drive the planet away from the initial state the civilization originated in and into domains that are detrimental to its sustainability. Our models conceptualize the problem primarily in terms of feedbacks from the resource use onto the coupled planetary systems. In addition, we also model the population growth advantages gained via the harvesting of these resources. We present three models of increasing complexity: (1) Civilization-planetary interaction with a single resource; (2) Civilization-planetary interaction with two resources each of which has a different level of planetary system feedback; (3) Civilization-planetary interaction with two resources and nonlinear planetary feedback (i.e., runaways). All three models show distinct classes of exo-civilization trajectories. We find smooth entries into long-term, “sustainable” steady states. We also find population booms followed by various levels of “die-off.” Finally, we also observe rapid “collapse” trajectories for which the population approaches n = 0. Our results are part of a program for developing an “Astrobiology of the Anthropocene” in which questions of sustainability, centered on the coupled Earth-system, can be seen in their proper astronomical/planetary context. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for both the coupled Earth system and for the consideration of exo-civilizations across cosmic history.

	abstract = {We present the activity and kinematics of a representative volume-limited (20 pc) sample of 152 late-M and L dwarfs (M7-L8) photometrically selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Using new proper-motion measurements and spectrophotometric distance estimates, we calculate tangential velocities. The sample has a mean tangential velocity of tan{\textgreater}=31.5 km s-1, a velocity dispersion of σtan=20.7 km s-1, and a maximum tangential velocity of Vtan=138.8 km s-1. These kinematic results are in excellent agreement with previous studies of ultracool dwarfs in the local solar neighborhood. Hα emission, an indicator of chromospheric activity, was detected in 63 of 81 late-M dwarfs and in 16 of 69 L dwarfs examined. We find a lack of correlation between activity strength, measured by log(FHα/Fbol), and Vtan, although velocity distributions suggest that the active dwarfs in our sample are slightly younger than the inactive dwarfs. Consistent with previous studies of activity in ultracool dwarfs, we find that the fraction of Hα-emitting objects per spectral type peaks at spectral type M7 and declines through mid-L dwarfs. Activity strength is similarly correlated with spectral type for types later than M7. Eleven dwarfs out of 150 show evidence of variability, ranging from small fluctuations to large flare events. We estimate a flare cycle of {\textasciitilde}5\% for late-M dwarfs and {\textasciitilde}2\% for L dwarfs. Observations of strong, variable activity on the L1 dwarf 2MASS J10224821+5825453 and an amazing flare event on the M7 dwarf 2MASS J1028404-143843 are discussed.},

New astrometric measurements obtained with the TRAPPIST telescope improve the distance measurement to 6.0 ± 1.0 pc and confirm the low tangential velocity (3.5 ± 0.6 km s-1) reported by Scholz. Low-resolution optical spectroscopy indicates a spectral type of M9.5 and prominent Hα emission ({\textless} \{\{log \}10\}\{\{L\}Hα \}/\{\{L\}bol\}{\textgreater} = -4.68 ± 0.06), but no evidence of subsolar metallicity or Li i absorption. Near-infrared spectroscopy reveals subtle peculiarities that can be explained by the presence of a T5 binary companion, and high-resolution laser guide star adaptive optics imaging reveals a faint (ΔH = 4.1) candidate source 0{\textbackslash}buildrel\{{\textbackslash}prime{\textbackslash}prime\}{\textbackslash}over\{.\} 14 (0.8 AU) from the primary. With high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectroscopy, we measure a stable radial velocity of +83.8 ± 0.3 km s-1, indicative of old disk kinematics and consistent with the angular separation of the possible companion. We measure a projected rotational velocity of v sin i = 8.0 ± 0.5 km s-1 and find evidence of low-level variabilty (∼1.5\%) in a 13 day TRAPPIST light curve, but cannot robustly constrain the rotational period. We also observe episodic changes in brightness (1\%-2\%) and occasional flare bursts (4\%-8\%) with a 0.8\% duty cycle, and order-of-magnitude variations in Hα line strength. Combined, these observations reveal WISE J0720-0846 to be an old, very low-mass binary whose components straddle the hydrogen burning minimum mass, and whose primary is a relatively rapid rotator and magnetically active. It is one of only two known binaries among late M dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun, both of which harbor a mid T-type brown dwarf companion. We show that while this specific configuration is rare (≲1.6\% probability), roughly 25\% of binary companions to late-type M dwarfs in the local population are likely low-temperature T or Y brown dwarfs.

Our analysis reveals the presence of a red asymmetry in the He λ10830 triplet, which is similar to signatures of coronal rain in the Sun. Photometry of the flare derived from an acquisition camera before spectroscopic observations and the ability to extract spectra from up-the-ramp observations with the HPF infrared detector enable us to perform time-series analysis of part of the flare and provide coarse constraints on the energy and frequency of such flares.

	abstract = {To fully characterize the atmospheres, or lack thereof, of terrestrial exoplanets, we must include the high-energy environments provided by their host stars. The nearby mid-M dwarf LHS 3844 hosts a terrestrial world that lacks a substantial atmosphere. We present a time-series UV spectrum of LHS 3844 from 1131 to 3215 Å captured by HST/COS. We detect one flare in the FUV that has an absolute energy of 8.96 ± 0.77 × 1028 erg and an equivalent duration of 355 ± 31 s. We extract the flare and quiescent UV spectra separately. For each spectrum, we estimate the Lyα flux using correlations between UV line strengths. We use Swift-XRT to place an upper limit on the soft X-ray flux and construct a differential emission model to estimate flux that is obscured by the interstellar medium. We compare the differential emission model flux estimates in the XUV to other methods that rely on scaling from the Lyα, Si iv, and N v lines in the UV. The XUV, FUV, and NUV flux of LHS 3844 relative to its bolometric luminosity is log10(Lband/LBol) =-3.65, -4.16, and -4.48, respectively, for the quiescent state. These values agree with trends in high-energy flux as a function of stellar effective temperature found by the MUSCLES survey for a sample of early-M dwarfs. Many of the most spectroscopically accessible terrestrial exoplanets orbit inactive mid-to-late M dwarfs like LHS 3844. Measurements of M dwarf high-energy spectra are preferable for exoplanet characterization but are not always possible. The spectrum of LHS 3844 is a useful proxy for the current radiation environment for these worlds.},

	abstract = {Small-scale magnetic reconnection processes in the form of nanoflares have become increasingly hypothesized as important mechanisms for the heating of the solar atmosphere, driving propagating disturbances along magnetic field lines in the Sun’s corona, and instigating rapid jetlike bursts in the chromosphere. Unfortunately, the relatively weak signatures associated with nanoflares place them below the sensitivities of current observational instrumentation. Here we employ Monte Carlo techniques to synthesize realistic nanoflare intensity time series from a dense grid of power-law indices and decay timescales. Employing statistical techniques, which examine the modeled intensity fluctuations with more than 107 discrete measurements, we show how it is possible to extract and quantify nanoflare characteristics throughout the solar atmosphere, even in the presence of significant photon noise. A comparison between the statistical parameters (derived through examination of the associated intensity fluctuation histograms) extracted from the Monte Carlo simulations and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 171 and 94 Å observations of active region NOAA 11366 reveals evidence for a flaring power-law index within the range of 1.82 ≤ α ≤ 1.90, combined with e-folding timescales of 385 ± 26 and 262 ± 17 s for the SDO/AIA 171 and 94 Å channels, respectively. These results suggest that nanoflare activity is not the dominant heating source for the active region under investigation. This opens the door for future dedicated observational campaigns to not only unequivocally search for the presence of small-scale reconnection in solar and stellar environments but also quantify key characteristics related to such nanoflare activity.},

The Orion Nebula Cluster offers a unique opportunity to study large samples of young low mass stars. This work is part of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep project (COUP), an {\textasciitilde}10 day long X-ray observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Aims: Our main goal is to statistically characterize the flare-like variability of 165 low mass (0.1-0.3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) ONC members in order to test and constrain the physical scenario in which flares explain all the observed emission. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: We adopt a maximum likelihood piece-wise representation of the observed X-ray light curves and detect flares by taking into account both the amplitude and time derivative of the count-rate. We then derive the frequency and energy distribution of the flares. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: The high energy tail of the energy distribution of flares is well described by a power-law with index {\textasciitilde}2.2. We test the hypothesis that light curves are built entirely by overlapping flares with a single power law energy distribution. We constrain the parameters of this simple model for every single light curve. The analysis of synthetic light curves obtained from the model indicates a good agreement with the observed data. Comparing low mass stars with stars in the mass interval (0.9-1.2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), we establish that, at {\textasciitilde}1 Myr, low mass and solar mass stars of similar X-ray luminosity have very similar flare frequencies. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: Our observational results are consistent with the following model/scenario: the light curves are entirely built by overlapping flares with a power-law intensity distribution; the intense flares are individually detected, while the weak ones merge and form a pseudo-quiescent level, which we indicate as the characteristic level.},

	abstract = {An open question in the field of solar and stellar astrophysics is the source of heating that causes stellar coronae to reach temperatures of millions of degrees. One possibility is that the coronae are heated by a large number of small flares. On the Sun, flares with energies as low as those of microflares are distributed with energy as a power law of the form (dN/dE){\textasciitilde}E-α, with α{\textasciitilde}1.8, and α appears to increase to values of 2.2-2.7 for flares of lower energy. If the slope exceeds the critical value of 2, then in principle the entire coronal energy input can be ascribed to flares that are increasingly less energetic but are more numerous. Previous analyses of flares in light curves of active stars have shown that this index generally is greater than 2, although it may be as low as 1.6 when strong flares alone are considered. Here we investigate the contribution of very weak flares, covering the milliflare energy range, to the coronal luminosity of low-mass active stars. We analyze Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer/Deep Survey events data from FK Aqr, V1054 Oph, and AD Leo and conclude that in all these cases, the coronal emission is dominated by flares to such an extent that in some cases, the entire emission can be ascribed to flare heating. We have developed a new method to directly model for the first time stochastically produced flare emission, including undetectable flares, and their effects on the observed photon arrival times. We find that αFKAqr=2.60+/-0.34, αV1054Oph=2.74+/-0.35, and αADLeo=2.03-2.32, and the flare component accounts for a large fraction (generally greater than 50\%) of the total flux.},

	abstract = {We examine observational evidence concerning energy release in solar flares. We propose that different processes may be operative on four different time scales: (a) on the sub-second time scale of ‘sub-bursts’ which are a prominent feature of mm-wave microwave records; (b) on the few-seconds time scale of ‘elementary bursts’ which are a prominent feature of hard X-ray records; (c) on the few-minutes time scale of the impulsive phase; and (d) on the tens-of-minutes or longer time scale of the gradual phase. We propose that the concentration of magnetic field into ‘magnetic knots’ at the photosphere has important consequences for the coronal magnetic-field structure such that the magnetic field in this region may be viewed as an array of ‘elementary flux tubes’. The release of the free energy of one such tube may produce an elementary burst. The development of magnetic islands during this process may be responsible for the sub-bursts. The impulsive phase may be simply the composite effect of many elementary bursts. We propose that the gradual phase of energy release, with which flares typically begin and with which many flares end, involves a steady process of reconnection, whereas the impulsive phase involves a more rapid stochastic process of reconnection which is a consequence of mode interaction. In the case of two-ribbon flares, the late part of the gradual phase may be attributed to reconnection of a large current sheet which is being produced as a result of filament eruption. A similar process may be operative in smaller flares.},

	abstract = {On UT 2009 January 16, we observed a white light megaflare on the dM4.5e star YZ CMi as part of a long-term spectroscopic flare-monitoring campaign to constrain the spectral shape of optical flare continuum emission. Simultaneous U-band photometric and 3350-9260 Å spectroscopic observations were obtained during 1.3 hr of the flare decay. The event persisted for more than 7 hr and at flare peak, the U-band flux was almost 6 mag brighter than in the quiescent state. The properties of this flare mark it as one of the most energetic and longest-lasting white light flares ever to be observed on an isolated low-mass star. We present the U-band flare energetics and a flare continuum analysis. For the first time, we show convincingly with spectra that the shape of the blue continuum from 3350 Å to 4800 Å can be represented as a sum of two components: a Balmer continuum as predicted by the Allred et al. radiative hydrodynamic flare models and a T{\textasciitilde} 10,000 K blackbody emission component as suggested by many previous studies of the broadband colors and spectral distributions of flares. The areal coverage of the Balmer continuum and blackbody emission regions vary during the flare decay, with the Balmer continuum emitting region always being significantly ({\textasciitilde}3-16 times) larger. These data will provide critical constraints for understanding the physics underlying the mysterious blue continuum radiation in stellar flares.

Its host star, Proxima Centauri, is however a strongly flaring star, which is expected to provide a very hostile environment for potentially habitable planets. We perform a habitability study of Proxima Centauri b assuming an Earth-like atmosphere under high stellar particle bombardment, with a focus on spectral transmission features. We employ our extensive model suite calculating energy spectra of stellar particles, their journey through the planetary magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere, ultimately providing planetary climate and spectral characteristics, as outlined in Herbst et al. Our results suggest that together with the incident stellar energy flux, high particle influxes can lead to efficient heating of the planet well into temperate climates, by limiting CH4 amounts, which would otherwise run into antigreenhouse for such planets around M stars. We identify some key spectral features relevant for future spectral observations: First, NO2 becomes the major absorber in the visible, which greatly impacts the Rayleigh slope. Second, H2O features can be masked by CH4 (near-infrared) and CO2 (mid- to far-infrared), making them nondetectable in transmission. Third, O3 is destroyed and instead HNO3 features become clearly visible in the mid- to far-infrared. Lastly, assuming a few percent of CO2 in the atmosphere, CO2 absorption at 5.3 μm becomes significant (for flare and nonflare cases), strongly overlapping with a flare related NO feature in Earth's atmosphere.},

Using these and modifying the form and intent of the Drake equation, we set a firm lower bound on the probability that one or more technological species have evolved anywhere and at any time in the history of the observable Universe. We find that as long as the probability that a habitable zone planet develops a technological species is larger than ∼10-24, humanity is not the only time technological intelligence has evolved. This constraint has important scientific and philosophical consequences.},

	abstract = {We extend and generalize to stellar X-ray flares the analysis of the decay phase of flares inside solar coronal loops of constant cross-section, and investigate related diagnostics from X-ray observations. The work is based on hydrodynamic simulations of compact stellar flares for different values of stellar surface gravity, loop length and peak temperature, and characteristics of loop heating during the decay phase. We discuss the validity of the thermodynamic scaling law of Serio et al. (1991) in the wider context of stellar flares, and find that a generalized version of this law holds if the loop half-length L is smaller than the peak pressure scale height h. In the light of the diagnostics which can be derived from the density-temperature (n-T) diagram, already tested for solar flares, we consider how the ratio ζ of the density decay time to the temperature decay time depends on gravity. We find that ζ, as computed at the top of the loop, has a maximum value ζ ∼ 3 for very small L/h and decreases as L/h increases. Alternatively we consider the average flare density and temperature as they would be derived from observations with the ROSAT PSPC or other moderate energy resolution detectors, we obtain a flatter curve, with a maximum value around 2. We discuss also how energy deposition during the flare decay phase influences ζ, and propose a combined diagnostic approach on stellar flares based on the joint use of the n-T diagrams and of the fitting of the light curve with hydrodynamic models. As a first practical result we can safely exclude the presence of sustained heating during the decay of an X-ray flare observed on Prox Cen by the EINSTEIN/IPC instrument.},

	abstract = {We report results from the December 89 multi-site continuous observing campaign (MUSICOS 89) dedicated to the study of surface active structures and flares on the RS CVn-type system HR1099 (=V711 Tau). This system has been observed by up to 17 telescopes around the globe during this campaign. We obtained complete phase coverage for Doppler imaging of photospheric spots. Quasi-simultaneously, we observed the modulation of Ca II K line profile due to chromospheric plage regions. At least two exceptional white-light flares on 14 Dec. 15:00 UT and 15 Dec. 1:00 UT (the largest such optical flare episode ever reported in a RS CVn system) were detected photometrically with typical rise and decay times of 60-90 min, and with remarkable spectral dynamic signatures in Hα, with longer decay time scale. Equivalent colours, temperature excesses and projected flare areas (0.55 and 0.89 solar disc areas) were derived for the two optical flares. We estimate the energy budget for these two events, with respective peak intensities of radiative losses of 1.65 and 1410{\textasciicircum}33{\textasciicircum}erg/s and integrated losses over the white-light event duration of a few hours of 8.10{\textasciicircum}36{\textasciicircum} and 10{\textasciicircum}38{\textasciicircum}ergs (in the 3100-5900A range), indicating a total energy balance several times these values. The emission was also measured in the Hα and Hβ lines during these flares with a ratio of flare optical emission over Balmer emission 3-4 times larger compared to other flares on dwarfs. More than one day after the last white-light flare, part of the flare decay phase was also measured with IUE in UV lines of low and high excitation; the extrapolated transition region EUV losses are found similar to the derived Balmer line losses. Both flares were shown to occur near the limb. We derive their physical area, and estimate their densities, column mass, and penetration depth. From Balmer line broadening and flows, we derive a kinetic energy budget comparable to the radiative losses. We discuss a possible magnetic energy budget and the interpretation in terms of filament ejection occurring over a magnetic arcade. These observations bring a new understanding and questions about energy transport mechanisms in stellar flares.},

We identified 42 solar flares with pronounced QPPs, observed with RHESSI, and 36 stellar flares with QPPs, observed with XMM-Newton. The empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method and least-squares fit by a damped sine function were applied to obtain the periods (P) and damping times (τ) of the QPPs. We found that (1) the periods and damping times of the stellar QPPs are 16.21 ± 15.86 minutes and 27.21 ± 28.73 minutes, while those of the solar QPPs are 0.90 ± 0.56 and 1.53 ± 1.10 minutes, respectively; (2) the ratios of the damping times to the periods (τ /P) observed in the stellar QPPs (1.69 ± 0.56) are statistically identical to those of solar QPPs (1.74 ± 0.77) and (3) the scalings of the QPP damping time with the period are well described by the power law in both solar and stellar cases. The power indices of the solar and stellar QPPs are 0.96 ± 0.10 and 0.98+/- 0.05, respectively. This scaling is consistent with the scalings found for standing slow magnetoacoustic and kink modes in solar coronal loops. Thus, we propose that the underlying mechanism responsible for the stellar QPPs is the natural magnetohydrodynamic oscillation in the flaring or adjacent coronal loops, as in the case of solar flares.},

	abstract = {The Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETG) spectra of the coronally active binary stars σ Gem and HR 1099 are among the highest fluence observations for such systems taken at high spectral resolution in X-rays with this instrument. This allows us to compare their properties in detail to solar flare spectra obtained with the Russian CORONAS-F spacecraft's RESIK instrument at similar resolution in an overlapping bandpass. Here we emphasize the detailed comparisons of the 3.3-6.1{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathring\{{\textbackslash}rm\{A\}\}\} region (including emission from highly ionized S, Si, Ar, and K) from solar flare spectra to the corresponding σ Gem and HR 1099 spectra. We also model the larger wavelength range of the HETG, from 1.7 to 25{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}mathring\{{\textbackslash}rm\{A\}\}\}—having emission lines from Fe, Ca, Ar, Si, Al, Mg, Ne, O, and N—to determine coronal temperatures and abundances. σ Gem is a single-lined coronally active long-period binary which has a very hot corona. HR 1099 is a similar, but shorter period, double-lined system. With very deep HETG exposures we can even study emission from some of the weaker species, such as K, Na, and Al, which are important since they have the lowest first ionization potentials, a parameter well known to be correlated with elemental fractionation in the solar corona. The solar flare temperatures reach ≈20 MK, comparable to the σ Gem and HR 1099 coronae. During the Chandra exposures, σ Gem was slowly decaying from a flare and its spectrum is well characterized by a collisional ionization equilibrium plasma with a broad temperature distribution ranging from 2 to 60 MK, peaking near 25 MK, but with substantial emission from 50 MK plasma. We have detected K XVIII and Na XI emission which allow us to set limits on their abundances. HR 1099 was also quite variable in X-rays, also in a flare state, but had no detectable K XVIII. These measurements provide new comparisons of solar and stellar coronal abundances, especially at the lowest first ionization potential (FIP) values. The low FIP elements do not show enhancement in the stellar coronae as they do in the Sun, except perhaps for K in σ Gem. While σ Gem and HR 1099 differ in their emission measure distributions, they have very similar elemental abundances.},

	abstract = {More than three thousand exoplanets have been detected so far, and more and more spectroscopic observations of exoplanets are performed. Future instruments (James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), E-ELT, PLATO, Ariel, etc.,) are eagerly awaited, as they will be able to provide spectroscopic data with greater accuracy and sensitivity than what is currently available. This will allow more accurate conclusions to be drawn regarding the chemistry and dynamics of exoplanetary atmospheres, provided that the observational data are carefully processed. One important aspect to consider is temporal stellar atmospheric disturbances that can influence the planetary composition, and hence spectra, and potentially can lead to incorrect assumptions about the steady-state atmospheric composition of the planet. In this paper, we focus on perturbations coming from the host star in the form of flare events that significantly increase photon flux impingement on the exoplanets atmosphere. In some cases, particularly for M stars, this sudden increase may last for several hours. We aim to discover to what extent a stellar flare is able to modify the chemical composition of the planetary atmosphere and, therefore, influence the resulting spectra. We use a one-dimensional thermo-photochemical model to study the neutral atmospheric composition of two hypothetical planets located around the star AD Leo. We place the two planets at different distances from the star, which results in effective atmospheric temperatures of 412 and 1303 K. AD Leo is an active star that has already been observed during a flare. Therefore, we use the spectroscopic data from this flare event to simulate the evolution of the chemical composition of the atmospheres of the two hypothetical planets. We compute synthetic spectra to evaluate the implications for observations. The increase in the incoming photon flux affects the chemical abundances of some important species (such as H and NH3), down to altitudes associated with an atmospheric pressure of 1 bar, which can lead to variations in planetary spectra (up to 150 ppm) if performed during transit. We find that each exoplanet has a post-flare steady-state composition that is significantly different from the pre-flare steady-state. We predict that these variations could be detectable with both current and future spectroscopic instruments, if sufficiently high signal-to-noise spectra are obtained.},

	abstract = {Space weather plays an important role in the evolution of planetary atmospheres. Observations have shown that stellar flares emit energy in a wide energy range (1030–1038 erg), a fraction of which lies in X-rays and extreme ultraviolet (XUV). These flares heat the upper atmosphere of a planet, leading to increased escape rates, and can result in atmospheric erosion over a period of time. Observations also suggest that primordial terrestrial planets can accrete voluminous H/He envelopes. Stellar radiation can erode these protoatmospheres over time, and the extent of this erosion has implications for the planet’s habitability. We use the energy-limited equation to calculate hydrodynamic escape rates from these protoatmospheres irradiated by XUV stellar flares and luminosity. We use the flare frequency distribution of 492 FGKM stars observed with TESS to estimate atmospheric loss in habitable zone planets. We find that for most stars, luminosity-induced escape is the main loss mechanism, with a minor contribution from flares. However, flares dominate the loss mechanism of ∼20 per cent M4–M10 stars. M0–M4 stars are most likely to completely erode both their proto- and secondary atmospheres, and M4–M10 are least likely to erode secondary atmospheres. We discuss the implications of these results on planetary habitability.},

Unexplained rapid bursts from the binary system TV Columbae, in which mass is accreted onto a moderately strong magnetized white dwarf from a low-mass companion, have been observed on several occasions in the past 40 years7–11. During these bursts, the optical/ultraviolet luminosity increases by a factor of more than  three in less than an hour and fades in around ten hours. Fast outflows have been observed in ultraviolet spectral lines7, with velocities of more than 3,500 kilometres per second, comparable to the escape velocity from the white dwarf surface. Here we report on optical bursts observed in TV Columbae and in two additional accreting systems, EI Ursae Majoris and ASASSN-19bh. The bursts have a total energy of approximately 10−6  times than those of classical nova explosions (micronovae) and bear a strong resemblance to type-I X-ray bursts12–14.

	abstract = {We report the first detection of a substantial brightening event in an isotopologue of a key molecular ion, HCO+, within a protoplanetary disk of a T Tauri star. The H13CO+ rotational transition was observed three times toward IM Lup between 2014 July and 2015 May with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. The first two observations show similar spectrally integrated line and continuum fluxes, while the third observation shows a doubling in the disk-integrated line flux compared to the continuum, which does not change between the three epochs. We explore models of an X-ray active star irradiating the disk via stellar flares, and find that the optically thin H13CO+ emission variation can potentially be explained via X-ray-driven chemistry temporarily enhancing the HCO+ abundance in the upper layers of the disk atmosphere during large or prolonged flaring events. If the HCO+ enhancement is indeed caused by an X-ray flare, future observations should be able to spatially resolve these events and potentially enable us to watch the chemical aftermath of the high-energy stellar radiation propagating across the face of protoplanetary disks, providing a new pathway to explore ionization physics and chemistry, including electron density, in disks.},

Consequently, the hazardous effect of the direct exposition to the stellar wind, for example, regarding the integrity of satellites orbiting the Earth or the habitability of exoplanets, depends upon the space weather conditions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The aim of the study is to analyze the response of an Earth-like magnetosphere for various space weather conditions and interplanetary coronal mass ejections. The magnetopause standoff distance, the open-close field line boundary, and plasma flows toward the planet surface are calculated. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We used the magnetohydrodynamics code PLUTO in spherical coordinates to perform a parametric study of the dynamic pressure and temperature of the stellar wind as well as of the interplanetary magnetic field intensity and orientation. The range of the parameters we analyzed extends from regular to extreme space weather conditions, which is consistent with coronal mass ejections at the Earth orbit for the present and early periods of the solar main sequence. In addition, implications of sub-Afvénic solar wind configurations for the Earth and exoplanet magnetospheres were analyzed. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The direct precipitation of the solar wind at the Earth dayside in equatorial latitudes is extremely unlikely even during super coronal mass ejections. On the other hand, for early evolution phases during the solar main sequence, when the solar rotation rate was at least five times faster (\&lt;440 Myr), the Earth surface was directly exposed to the solar wind during coronal mass ejections. Today, satellites at high, geosynchronous, and medium orbits are directly exposed to the solar wind during coronal mass ejections because part of the orbit at the Earth dayside is beyond the nose of the bow shock.},

As with most non-trivial observables, a simple histogram of estimated eccentricities is not a good estimate of the true eccentricity distribution. Here, we develop and test a hierarchical probabilistic method for performing the relevant meta-analysis, that is, inferring the true eccentricity distribution, taking as input the likelihood functions for the individual star eccentricities, or samplings of the posterior probability distributions for the eccentricities (under a given, uninformative prior). The method is a simple implementation of a hierarchical Bayesian model; it can also be seen as a kind of heteroscedastic deconvolution. It can be applied to any quantity measured with finite precision—other orbital parameters, or indeed any astronomical measurements of any kind, including magnitudes, distances, or photometric redshifts—so long as the measurements have been communicated as a likelihood function or a posterior sampling.},

We conduct an investigation of the mutual inclinations between the stellar companion and planetary orbits using Gaia EDR3, which is possible because transiting exoplanets must orbit within the line of sight; thus, stellar companion kinematics can constrain mutual inclinations.

Two sub-classes of these exoplanets, "hot Jupiters" and their less massive counterparts "hot Neptunes," provide a unique opportunity to study the extended atmospheres of planets outside of our solar system. We describe here the first far-ultraviolet transit study of a hot Neptune, specifically GJ 436b, for which we use Hubble Space Telescope/Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph Lyα spectra to measure stellar flux as a function of time, observing variations due to absorption from the planetary atmosphere during transit. This analysis permits us to derive information about atmospheric extent, mass-loss rate from the planet, and interactions between the star and planet. We observe an evolution of the Lyα lightcurve with a transit depth of GJ 436b from 8.8\% ± 4.5\% near mid-transit, to 22.9\% ± 3.9\% {\textasciitilde}2 hr after the nominal geometric egress of the planet. Using data from the time-tag mode and considering astrophysical noise from stellar variability, we calculate a post-egress occultation of 23.7\% ± 4.5\%, demonstrating that the signature is statistically significant and of greater amplitude than can be attributed to stellar fluctuations alone. The extended egress absorption indicates the probable existence of a comet-like tail trailing the exoplanet. We calculate a mass-loss rate for GJ 436b in the range of 3.7 × 106-1.1 × 109 g s-1, corresponding to an atmospheric lifetime of 4 × 1011-2 × 1014 yr.},

Optical and infrared spectroscopy indicate a spectral type of L0 with strong Hα emission and a blue NIR spectral slope.

After compiling various radial velocity and high-resolution imaging surveys, we determine that binaries with a {\textless} 1 au fully suppress S-type planets, binaries with a = 10 au host close planets at 15\$\_\{-12\}{\textasciicircum}\{+17\}\$ per cent the occurrence rate of single stars, and wide binaries with a {\textgreater} 200 au have a negligible effect on close planet formation. We show that F = 43 ± 7 per cent of solar-type primaries in magnitude-limited samples do not host close planets due to suppression by close stellar companions. By removing spectroscopic binaries from their samples, radial velocity surveys for giant planets boost their detection rates by a factor of 1/(1-F) = 1.8 ± 0.2 compared to transiting surveys. This selection bias fully accounts for the discrepancy in hot Jupiter and close Neptune occurrence rates inferred from these two detection methods. Correcting for both planet suppression by close binaries and transit dilution by wide binaries, the occurrence rate of small planets orbiting single G-dwarfs is 2.1 ± 0.3 times larger than the rate inferred from all G-dwarfs in the Kepler survey. Additionally, about half (but not all) of the observed increase in small, short-period planets towards low-mass hosts can be explained by the corresponding decrease in the binary fraction.},

We demonstrate that the two distinct segments of the boundary are a direct consequence of the different slopes of the empirical mass-radius relation for small and large planets, and show that this relation also fixes the mass coordinate of the intersection point. The period coordinate of this point, as well as the detailed shape of the lower boundary, can be reproduced with a plausible choice of a key parameter in the underlying migration model. The detailed shape of the upper boundary, on the other hand, is determined by the post-circularization tidal exchange of angular momentum with the star and can be reproduced with a stellar tidal quality factor \{Q\}*{\textbackslash}prime ∼ \{10\}6.},

We establish an efficient procedure for determining the stellar parameters T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and log g of all sources using a method based on SED fitting, utilizing a three-dimensional dust map and proper motion information. In this way we identify more than 60 000 M dwarfs, which is by far the largest sample of low-mass stars observed in a transit survey to date. We present several planet candidates around M dwarfs and hotter stars that are currently being followed up. Using Monte Carlo simulations we calculate the detection efficiency of the Pan-Planets survey for different stellar and planetary populations. We expect to find 3.0{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+3.3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-1.6{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} hot Jupiters around F, G, and K dwarfs with periods lower than 10 days based on the planet occurrence rates derived in previous surveys. For M dwarfs, the percentage of stars with a hot Jupiter is under debate. Theoretical models expect a lower occurrence rate than for larger main sequence stars. However, radial velocity surveys find upper limits of about 1\% due to their small sample, while the Kepler survey finds a occurrence rate that we estimate to be at least 0.17b({\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.67{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.04{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \%, making it even higher than the determined fraction from OGLE-III for F, G and K stellar types, 0.14 ({\textless}SUP{\textgreater}+0.15{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}-0.076{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \%.

If, however, none of our candidates turn out to be true planets, we are able to put an upper limit of 0.34\% with a 95\% confidence on the hot Jupiter occurrence rate of M dwarfs. This limit is a significant improvement over previous estimates where the lowest limit published so far is 1.1\% found in the WFCAM Transit Survey.

We explore this connection by analyzing the metallicities of Kepler target stars and the subset of stars found to host transiting planets. After correcting for survey incompleteness, we measure planet occurrence: the number of planets per 100 stars with a given metallicity M. Planet occurrence correlates with metallicity for some, but not all, planet sizes and orbital periods. For warm super-Earths having P = 10–100 days and = 1.0–1.7 , planet occurrence is nearly constant over metallicities spanning −0.4 to +0.4 dex. We find 20 warm super-Earths per 100 stars, regardless of metallicity. In contrast, the occurrence of warm sub-Neptunes ( = 1.7–4.0 ) doubles over that same metallicity interval, from 20 to 40 planets per 100 stars. We model the distribution of planets as , where β characterizes the strength of any metallicity correlation. This correlation steepens with decreasing orbital period and increasing planet size. For warm super-Earths β = , while for hot Jupiters β = . High metallicities in protoplanetary disks may increase the mass of the largest rocky cores or the speed at which they are assembled, enhancing the production of planets larger than 1.7 . The association between high metallicity and short-period planets may reflect disk density profiles that facilitate the inward migration of solids or higher rates of planet–planet scattering.},

	abstract = {Hot Jupiters are a rare and interesting outcome of planet formation. Although more than 500 hot Jupiters (HJs) are known, most of them were discovered by a heterogeneous collection of surveys with selection biases that are difficult to quantify. Currently, our best knowledge of HJ demographics around FGK stars comes from the sample of ≍40 objects detected by the Kepler mission, which have a well-quantified selection function. Using the Kepler results, we simulate the characteristics of the population of nearby transiting HJs. A comparison between the known sample of nearby HJs and simulated magnitude-limited samples leads to four conclusions. (1) The known sample of HJs appears to be ≍75\% complete for stars brighter than Gaia G ≤ 10.5, falling to ≲50\% for G ≤ 12. (2) There are probably a few undiscovered HJs with host stars brighter than G ≍ 10 located within 10° of the Galactic plane. (3) The period and radius distributions of HJs may differ for F-type hosts (which dominate the nearby sample) and G-type hosts (which dominate the Kepler sample). (4) To obtain a magnitude-limited sample of HJs that is larger than the Kepler sample by an order of magnitude, the limiting magnitude should be approximately G ≍ 12.5. This magnitude limit is within the range for which NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite can easily detect HJs, presenting the opportunity to greatly expand our knowledge of hot-Jupiter demographics.},

	abstract = {Context. Exoplanets with orbital periods of less than one day are know as Ultra-short period (USP) planets. They are relatively rare products of planetary formation and evolution processes, but especially favourable to current planet detection methods. At the time of writing, 120 USP planets have already been confirmed. Aims. We aim to confirm the planetary nature of two new transiting planet candidates announced by the NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), registered as TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) TOI-1442.01 and TOI-2445.01. Methods. We use the TESS data, ground-based photometric light-curves and Subaru/IRD spectrograph radial velocity (RV) measurements to validate both planetary candidates and to establish their physical properties. Results. TOI-1442 b is a hot super-Earth with an orbital period of \$P = 0.4090682 {\textbackslash}pm 0.0000004 {\textbackslash}, d\$, a radius of \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p\}\} = 1.15 {\textbackslash}pm 0.06 {\textbackslash}, R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, equilibrium temperature of \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p,eq\}\} = 1357\_\{-42\}{\textasciicircum}\{+49\} {\textbackslash}, K\$, and a mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p\}\} {\textless} 18 {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ at 3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$. TOI-2445 b is also a hot super-Earth/mini-Neptune with an orbital period of \$P = 0.3711286 {\textbackslash}pm 0.0000004 {\textbackslash}, d\$, a radius of \$R\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p\}\} = 1.33 {\textbackslash}pm 0.09 {\textbackslash}, R\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$, equilibrium temperature of \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p,eq\}\} = 1330\_\{-56\}{\textasciicircum}\{+61\} {\textbackslash}, K\$, and a mass \$M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{p\}\} {\textless} 38 {\textbackslash}, M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ at 3\${\textbackslash}sigma\$. Their physical properties align with current empirical trends and formation theories of USP planets. More RV measurements will be useful to constrain the planetary masses and mean densities, as well as the predicted presence of outer planetary companions.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a survey aimed at discovering and studying transiting planets with orbital periods shorter than one day (ultra-short-period, or USP, planets), using data from the Kepler spacecraft. We computed Fourier transforms of the photometric time series for all 200,000 target stars, and detected transit signals based on the presence of regularly spaced sharp peaks in the Fourier spectrum. We present a list of 106 USP candidates, of which 18 have not previously been described in the literature. This list of candidates increases the number of planet candidates with orbital periods shorter than about six hours from two to seven. In addition, among the objects we studied, there are 26 USP candidates that had been previously reported in the literature which do not pass our various tests. All 106 of our candidates have passed several standard tests to rule out false positives due to eclipsing stellar systems. A low false positive rate is also implied by the relatively high fraction of candidates for which more than one transiting planet signal was detected. By assuming these multi-transit candidates represent coplanar multi-planet systems, we are able to infer that the USP planets are typically accompanied by other planets with periods in the range 1-50 days, in contrast with hot Jupiters which very rarely have companions in that same period range. Another clear pattern is that almost all USP planets are smaller than 2 R ⊕, possibly because gas giants in very tight orbits would lose their atmospheres by photoevaporation when subject to extremely strong stellar irradiation. Based on our survey statistics, USP planets exist around approximately (0.51 ± 0.07)\% of G-dwarf stars, and (0.83 ± 0.18)\% of K-dwarf stars.},

Recently, three Earth-sized planets were detected that transit (that is, pass in front of) a star with a mass just eight per cent that of the Sun, located 12 parsecs away. The transiting configuration of these planets, combined with the Jupiter-like size of their host star—named TRAPPIST-1—makes possible in-depth studies of their atmospheric properties with present-day and future astronomical facilities. Here we report the results of a photometric monitoring campaign of that star from the ground and space. Our observations reveal that at least seven planets with sizes and masses similar to those of Earth revolve around TRAPPIST-1. The six inner planets form a near-resonant chain, such that their orbital periods (1.51, 2.42, 4.04, 6.06, 9.1 and 12.35 days) are near-ratios of small integers. This architecture suggests that the planets formed farther from the star and migrated inwards. Moreover, the seven planets have equilibrium temperatures low enough to make possible the presence of liquid water on their surfaces.},

	abstract = {Ultra-short-period (USP) planets are an enigmatic subset of exoplanets defined by having orbital periods {\textless}1 day. It is still not understood how USP planets form, or to what degree they differ from planets with longer orbital periods. Most USP planets have radii {\textless}2 R⊕, while planets that orbit further from their star extend to Jupiter size ({\textgreater}10 R⊕). Several theories attempt to explain the formation and composition of USP planets: they could be remnant cores of larger gas giants that lost their atmospheres due to photoevaporation or Roche-lobe overflow, or they could have developed through mass accretion in the innermost part of the protoplanetary disk. The radius and mass distribution of USP planets could provide important clues to distinguish between potential formation mechanisms. In this study, we first verify and update the Kepler catalog of USP planet host star properties, incorporating new data collected by the Gaia mission where applicable. We then use the transit depths measured by Kepler to derive a radius distribution and present occurrence rates for USP planets. Using spherical and tidally distorted planet models, we then derive a mass distribution for USP planets. Comparisons between the updated USP planet mass distribution and simulated planetary systems offer further insights into the formation and evolutionary processes shaping USP planet populations.},

In this Chapter, we first summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the two detection methods that have unveiled the population of short- and intermediate-separation exoplanets, i.e. the radial velocity (RV) and photometric transit techniques. Secondly, we review the wealth of information on the statistical properties of close-in exoplanets gathered from Doppler and transit surveys, focusing on occurrence rates as a function of two fundamental physical properties, mass and radius, and orbital separation. Next, we discuss statistical trends and correlations in the orbital and structural properties of two classes of planets that are not found in our Solar System, super Earths and sub-Neptunes. Then, we present an overview of the global and planet-to-planet patterns in the demographics of multiple-plane systems. We conclude by discussing the (primarily dynamical) information content of the orbital architectures of close-in planets (eccentricities, obliquities), and by highlighting the peculiar properties of the class of ultra-short period exoplanets. Throughout this Chapter, we underline key aspects of the fundamental link between planetary and host stars' properties and stress relevant elements of the mutual feedback between observations and theory (This Chapter is based on the lecture series given in May 2019 by A. Howard.).},

MKT J174641.0-321404 is highly variable at 1.3 GHz and was detected three times during 11 observations of the field in late 2018, reaching a maximum flux density of 590 ± 60 μJy. We associate this radio transient with a high proper motion, M dwarf star SCR 1746-3214 12 pc away from the Sun. Multiwavelength observations of this M dwarf indicate flaring activity across the electromagnetic spectrum, consistent with emission expected from dMe stars, and providing upper limits on quiescent brightness in both the radio and X-ray regimes. TESS photometry reveals a rotational period for SCR 1746-3214 of 0.2292 ± 0.0025 days, which at its estimated radius makes the star a rapid rotator, comparable to other low mass systems. Dedicated spectroscopic follow up confirms the star as a mid-late spectral M dwarf with clear magnetic activity indicated by strong Hα emission. This transient's serendipitous discovery by MeerKAT, along with multiwavelength characterisation, make it a prime demonstration of both the capabilities of the current generation of radio interferometers and the value of simultaneous observations by optical facilities such as MeerLICHT. Our results build upon the literature of of M dwarfs' flaring behaviour, particularly relevant to the habitability of their planetary systems.},

We revised the properties of candidate transiting planets using the stellar parameters, high-resolution imaging to identify companion stars, and, in the case of binaries, fitting light curves to identify the likely planet host. In 49 of 54 systems, we validated the primary as the host star. We inferred the intrinsic distribution of M dwarf planets using the method of iterative Monte Carlo simulation. We compared several models of planet orbital geometry and clustering and found that one where planets are exponentially distributed and almost precisely coplanar best describes the distribution of multiplanet systems. We determined that Kepler M dwarfs host an average of 2.2 ± 0.3 planets with radii of 1–4 R⊕ and orbital periods of 1.5–180 d. The radius distribution peaks at ∼1.2 R⊕ and is essentially zero at 4 R⊕, although we identify three giant planet candidates other than the previously confirmed Kepler-45b. There is suggestive but not significant evidence that the radius distribution varies with orbital period. The distribution with logarithmic orbital period is flat except for a decline for orbits less than a few days. 12 candidate planets, including two Jupiter-size objects, experience an irradiance below the threshold level for a runaway greenhouse on an Earth-like planet and are thus in a ‘habitable zone’.},

Ground-based follow-up combined with diagnostic vetting and validation tests enables us to rule out common astrophysical false-positive scenarios and validate the system of planets. The outermost planet, TOI-700 d, has a radius of 1.19 ± 0.11 R⊕ and resides within a conservative estimate of the host star's habitable zone, where it receives a flux from its star that is approximately 86\% of Earth's insolation. In contrast to some other low-mass stars that host Earth-sized planets in their habitable zones, TOI-700 exhibits low levels of stellar activity, presenting a valuable opportunity to study potentially rocky planets over a wide range of conditions affecting atmospheric escape. While atmospheric characterization of TOI-700 d with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be challenging, the larger sub-Neptune, TOI-700 c (R = 2.63 R⊕), will be an excellent target for JWST and future space-based observatories. TESS is scheduled to once again observe the Southern Hemisphere, and it will monitor TOI-700 for an additional 11 sectors in its extended mission.

	abstract = {Determining whether Earth-like planets are common or rare looms as a touchstone in the question of life in the universe. We searched for Earth-size planets that cross in front of their host stars by examining the brightness measurements of 42,000 stars from National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Kepler mission. We found 603 planets, including 10 that are Earth size (1-2 Earth-radii) and receive comparable levels of stellar energy to that of Earth (within a factor of four). We account for Kepler's imperfect detectability of such planets by injecting synthetic planet-caused dimmings into the Kepler brightness measurements and recording the fraction detected. We find that 11±4\% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet receiving between one and four times the stellar intensity as Earth. We also find that the occurrence of Earth-size planets is constant with increasing orbital period (P), within equal intervals of logP up to ∼200 d. Extrapolating, one finds 5.7{\textasciicircum}\{+1.7\}\_\{-2.2\}\% of Sun-like stars harbor an Earth-size planet with orbital periods of 200-400 d.},

Our analysis considers errors in planet radii and includes an "iterative simulation" technique that does not bin the data. We find a radius distribution that peaks at 2-2.8 Earth radii, with lower numbers of smaller and larger planets. These planets are uniformly distributed with logarithmic period, and the mean number of such planets per star is 0.46 ± 0.03. The occurrence is {\textasciitilde}0.66 if planets interior to 20 days are included. We estimate the occurrence of Earth-size planets in the "habitable zone" (defined as 1-2 R ⊕, 0.99-1.7 AU for solar-twin stars) as 6.4+3.4-1.1 \%. Our results largely agree with those of Petigura et al., although we find a higher occurrence of 2.8-4 Earth-radii planets. The reasons for this excess are the inclusion of errors in planet radius, updated Huber et al. stellar parameters, and also the exclusion of planets that may have been affected by proximity to the host star.},

	abstract = {Terrestrial planets in the habitable zones (HZs) of low-mass stars and cool dwarfs have received significant scrutiny recently. Transit spectroscopy of such planets with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) represents our best shot at obtaining the spectrum of a habitable planet within the next decade. As these planets are likely tidally locked, improved 3D numerical simulations of such planetary atmospheres are needed to guide target selection. Here we use a 3D climate system model, updated with new water-vapor absorption coefficients derived from the HITRAN 2012 database, to study ocean-covered planets at the inner edge of the HZ around late M to mid-K stars (2600 \{\{K\}\}≤slant \{T\}\{eff\}≤slant 4500 \{\{K\}\}). Our results indicate that these updated water-vapor coefficients result in significant warming compared to previous studies, so the inner HZ around M dwarfs is not as close as suggested by earlier work. Assuming synchronously rotating Earth-sized and Earth-mass planets with background 1 bar \{\{\{N\}\}\}2 atmospheres, we find that planets at the inner HZ of stars with \{T\}\{eff\}{\textgreater} 3000 \{\{K\}\} undergo the classical “moist greenhouse” (\{\{\{H\}\}\}2\{\{O\}\} mixing ratio {\textgreater} \{10\}-3 in the stratosphere) at significantly lower surface temperature (∼280 K) in our 3D model compared with 1D climate models (∼340 K). This implies that some planets around low-mass stars can simultaneously undergo water loss and remain habitable. However, for stars with \{T\}\{eff\}≤slant 3000 \{\{K\}\}, planets at the inner HZ may directly transition to a runaway state, while bypassing the moist greenhouse water loss entirely. We analyze transmission spectra of planets in a moist greenhouse regime and find that there are several prominent \{\{\{H\}\}\}2\{\{O\}\} features, including a broad feature between 5 and 8 μm, within JWST MIRI instrument range. Thus, relying only on standard Earth-analog spectra with 24 hr rotation period around M dwarfs for habitability studies will miss the strong \{\{\{H\}\}\}2\{\{O\}\} features that one would expect to see on synchronously rotating planets around M dwarf stars, with JWST.},

	abstract = {The ease of interstellar rocket travel is an issue with implications for the long-term fate of our own and other civilizations and for the much-debated number of technological civilizations in the Galaxy. We show that the physical barrier to interstellar travel can be greatly reduced if voyagers are patient, and wait for the close passage of another star. For a representative time of ∼1 Gyr, characteristic of the remaining time that Earth will remain habitable, one anticipates a passage of another star within ∼1500 au. This lowers the travel time for interstellar migration by ∼two orders of magnitude compared with calculated travel times based on distances comparable to average interstellar separations (i.e., ∼1 pc) in the solar vicinity. We consider the implications for how long-lived civilizations may respond to stellar evolution, including the case of stars in wide binaries, and the difficulties of identifying systems currently undergoing a relevant close encounter. Assuming that life originates only around G-type stars, but migrates primarily to lower mass hosts when the original system becomes uninhabitable, the fraction of extant technological civilizations that exist as diaspora can be comparable to the fraction that still orbit their original host stars.},

We provide the first analysis in terms of star-dependent instellation flux, which allows us to track HZ planets. We define η⊕ as the HZ occurrence of planets with radii between 0.5 and 1.5 R⊕ orbiting stars with effective temperatures between 4800 and 6300 K. We find that η⊕ for the conservative HZ is between (errors reflect 68\% credible intervals) and planets per star, while the optimistic HZ occurrence is between and planets per star. These bounds reflect two extreme assumptions about the extrapolation of completeness beyond orbital periods where DR25 completeness data are available. The large uncertainties are due to the small number of detected small HZ planets. We find similar occurrence rates between using Poisson likelihood Bayesian analysis and using Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results are corrected for catalog completeness and reliability. Both completeness and the planet occurrence rate are dependent on stellar effective temperature. We also present occurrence rates for various stellar populations and planet size ranges. We estimate with 95\% confidence that, on average, the nearest HZ planet around G and K dwarfs is ∼6 pc away and there are ∼4 HZ rocky planets around G and K dwarfs within 10 pc of the Sun.},

We estimate how much light is needed for the UV photochemistry by experimentally measuring the rate constant for the UV chemistry (`light chemistry', needed for prebiotic synthesis) versus the rate constants for the bimolecular reactions that happen in the absence of the UV light (`dark chemistry'). We make these measurements for representative photochemical reactions involving SO\$\_3{\textasciicircum}\{2-\}\$ and HS\${\textasciicircum}-\$. By balancing the rates for the light and dark chemistry, we delineate the "abiogenesis zones" around stars of different stellar types based on whether their UV fluxes are sufficient for building up this macromolecular prebiotic inventory. We find that the SO\$\_3{\textasciicircum}\{2-\}\$ 'light chemistry' is rapid enough to build up the prebiotic inventory for stars hotter than K5 (4400 K). We show how the abiogenesis zone overlaps with the liquid water habitable zone. Stars cooler than K5 may also drive the formation of these building blocks if they are very active. The HS\${\textasciicircum}-\$ 'light chemistry' is too slow to work even for the Early Earth.},

	abstract = {We present near-UV (NUV) flare spectra from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph during two moderate-amplitude U-band flares on the dM4e star GJ 1243. These spectra are some of the first accurately flux-calibrated, NUV flare spectra obtained over the impulsive phase in M dwarf flares. We observed these flares with a fleet of nine ground-based telescopes simultaneously, which provided broadband photometry and low-resolution spectra at the Balmer jump. An increase in the broadband continuum occurred with a signal-to-noise ratio {\textgreater}20 in the HST spectra, while numerous Fe II lines and the Mg II lines also increased but with smaller flux enhancements than the continuum radiation. These two events produced the most prominent Balmer line radiation and the largest Balmer jumps that have been observed to date in dMe flare spectra. A T = 9000 K blackbody underestimates the NUV continuum flare flux by a factor of two and is a poor approximation to the white light in these types of flare events. Instead, our data suggest that the peak of the specific continuum flux density is constrained to U-band wavelengths near the Balmer series limit. A radiative-hydrodynamic simulation of a very high energy deposition rate averaged over times of impulsive heating and cooling better explains the properties of the λ {\textgreater} 2500 Å flare continuum. These two events sample only one end of the empirical color-color distribution for dMe flares, and more time-resolved flare spectra in the NUV, U band, and optical from 2000 to 4200 Å are needed during more impulsive and/or more energetic flares.},

Here we present the results of a systematic search for ultrafast rotators (UFRs) in the Southern ecliptic hemisphere, which were observed in 2-min cadence with TESS. Using data from Gaia DR2, we obtain a sample of over 13 000 stars close to the lower main sequence. Of these, we identify 609 stars that lie on the lower main sequence and have a periodic modulation {\textless}1 d. The fraction of stars that show flares appears to drop significantly at periods {\textless}0.2 d. If the periods are a signature of the rotation rate, this would be a surprise, since faster rotators would be expected to have a stronger magnetic field and, therefore, produce more flares. We explore possible reasons for our finding: The flare inactive stars are members of binaries, in which case the stars rotation rate could have increased as the binary orbital separation reduced due to angular momentum loss over time, or that enhanced emission occurs at blue wavelengths beyond the pass band of TESS. Follow-up spectroscopy and flare monitoring at blue/ultraviolet wavelengths of these flare inactive stars are required to resolve this question.},

	abstract = {The system of two transiting Neptune-sized planets around the bright, young M-dwarf AU Mic provides a unique opportunity to test models of planet formation, early evolution, and star-planet interaction. However, the intense magnetic activity of the host star makes measuring the masses of the planets via the radial velocity (RV) method very challenging. We report on a 1-yr, intensive monitoring campaign of the system using 91 observations with the HARPS spectrograph, allowing for detailed modelling of the {\textasciitilde}600 \$\{{\textbackslash}rm m{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ peak-to-peak activity-induced RV variations. We used a multidimensional Gaussian Process framework to model these and the planetary signals simultaneously. We detect the latter with semi-amplitudes of Kb = 5.8 ± 2.5 \$\{{\textbackslash}rm m{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ and Kc = 8.5 ± 2.5 \$\{{\textbackslash}rm m{\textbackslash}, s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$, respectively. The resulting mass estimates, Mb = 11.7 ± 5.0 M⊕ and Mc = 22.2 ± 6.7 M⊕, suggest that planet b might be less dense, and planet c considerably denser than previously thought. These results are in tension with the current standard models of core-accretion. They suggest that both planets accreted a H/He envelope that is smaller than expected, and the trend between the two planets' envelope fractions is the opposite of what is predicted by theory.},

We aim to understand possible SPIs in this system, which requires a detailed understanding of the stellar magnetic field and wind impinging on the planet. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Using spectropolarimetric observations and Zeeman Doppler Imaging, we derived a map of the large-scale stellar magnetic field.

The field has a mostly dipolar geometry; the dipole is tilted by 90° with respect to the rotation axis and the dipolar strength is 5.8 G at the magnetic pole. The wind simulations based on this magnetic geometry lead us to conclude that 55 Cnc e orbits inside the Alfvén surface of the stellar wind, implying that effects from the planet on the wind can propagate back to the stellar surface and result in SPI. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations obtained at the Telescope Bernard Lyot (USR5026) operated by the Observatoire Midi-Pyrénées, Université de Toulouse (Paul Sabatier), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France.},

	abstract = {The long-term carbon cycle is vital for maintaining liquid water oceans on rocky planets due to the negative climate feedbacks involved in silicate weathering. Plate tectonics plays a crucial role in driving the long-term carbon cycle because it is responsible for CO2 degassing at ridges and arcs, the return of CO2 to the mantle through subduction, and supplying fresh, weatherable rock to the surface via uplift and orogeny. However, the presence of plate tectonics itself may depend on climate according to recent geodynamical studies showing that cool surface temperatures are important for maintaining vigorous plate tectonics. Using a simple carbon cycle model, I show that the negative climate feedbacks inherent in the long-term carbon cycle are uninhibited by climate's effect on plate tectonics. Furthermore, initial atmospheric CO2 conditions do not impact the final climate state reached when the carbon cycle comes to equilibrium, as long as liquid water is present and silicate weathering can occur. Thus an initially hot, CO2 rich atmosphere does not prevent the development of a temperate climate and plate tectonics on a planet. However, globally supply limited weathering does prevent the development of temperate climates on planets with small subaerial land areas and large total CO2 budgets because supply limited weathering lacks stabilizing climate feedbacks. Planets in the supply limited regime may become inhospitable for life and could experience significant water loss. Supply limited weathering is less likely on plate tectonic planets because plate tectonics promotes high erosion rates and thus a greater supply of bedrock to the surface.},

Habitability has been traditionally defined in terms of an orbital semimajor axis within a range known as the habitable zone, but it is also well known that the habitability of Earth is due to many other astrophysical, geological, and geochemical factors. We focus this review on (1) recent refinements to habitable zone calculations; (2) the formation and orbital stability of terrestrial planets; (3) the tempo and mode of geologic activity (e.g., plate tectonics) on terrestrial planets; (4) the delivery of water to terrestrial planets in the habitable zone; and (5) the acquisition and loss of terrestrial planet carbon and nitrogen, elements that constitute important atmospheric gases responsible for habitable conditions on Earth's surface as well as being the building blocks of the biosphere itself. Finally, we consider recent work on evidence for the earliest habitable environments and the appearance of life itself on our planet. Such evidence provides us with an important, if nominal, calibration point for our search for other habitable worlds. Astrobiology 5, 100–126.},

Using an established light-curve inversion algorithm, we study the evolution of the surface features based on Kepler space telescope light curves over a period of two years (with a gap of .25 years). At virtually all epochs, we detect at least one large spot group on the surface causing a 1\%-10\% flux modulation in the Kepler passband. By identifying and tracking spot groups over a range of inferred latitudes, we measured the surface differential rotation to be much smaller than that found for the Sun. We also searched for a correlation between the 17 stellar flares that occurred during our observations and the orientation of the dominant surface spot at the time of each flare. No statistically significant correlation was found except perhaps for the very brightest flares, suggesting that most flares are associated with regions devoid of spots or spots too small to be clearly discerned using our reconstruction technique. While we may see hints of long-term changes in the spot characteristics and flare statistics within our current data set, a longer baseline of observation will be needed to detect the existence of a magnetic cycle in KIC 5110407.},

Observations of transiting exoplanets in the triplet of metastable helium lines at 10830 Å allow extended atmospheres and escape processes to be studied for individual planets. We observed one transit of WASP-107b with NIRSPEC on Keck at 10830 Å. Our observations, for the first time, had significant posttransit phase coverage, and we detected excess absorption for over an hour after fourth contact. The data can be explained by a comet-like tail extending out to {\textasciitilde}7 planet radii, which corresponds to roughly twice the Roche lobe radius of the planet. Planetary tails are expected based on three-dimensional simulations of escaping exoplanet atmospheres, particularly those including the interaction between the escaped material and strong stellar winds, and have been previously observed at 10830 Å in at least one other exoplanet.

Atmospheric mass loss primarily affects low-mass exoplanets, leading to the suggestion that hot rocky planets might have begun as Neptune-like, but subsequently lost all of their atmospheres; however, no confident measurements have hitherto been available. The signature of this loss could be observed in the ultraviolet spectrum, when the planet and its escaping atmosphere transit the star, giving rise to deeper and longer transit signatures than in the optical spectrum. Here we report that in the ultraviolet the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b (also known as Gliese 436b) has transit depths of 56.3 +/- 3.5\% (1σ), far beyond the 0.69\% optical transit depth. The ultraviolet transits repeatedly start about two hours before, and end more than three hours after the approximately one hour optical transit, which is substantially different from one previous claim (based on an inaccurate ephemeris). We infer from this that the planet is surrounded and trailed by a large exospheric cloud composed mainly of hydrogen atoms. We estimate a mass-loss rate in the range of about 108-109 grams per second, which is far too small to deplete the atmosphere of a Neptune-like planet in the lifetime of the parent star, but would have been much greater in the past.},

Analogous to binaries, planetary companions are also thought to be able to cause higher activity levels in their host stars, although at lower levels. Especially in X-rays, such influences are hard to detect because coronae of cool stars exhibit a considerable amount of intrinsic variability. Recently, a correlation between the mass of close-in exoplanets and their host star's X-ray luminosity has been detected, based on archival X-ray data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. This finding has been interpreted as evidence for star-planet interactions. We show in our analysis that this correlation is caused by selection effects due to the flux limit of the X-ray data used and due to the intrinsic planet detectability of the radial velocity method, and thus does not trace possible planet-induced effects. We also show that the correlation is not present in a corresponding complete sample derived from combined XMM-Newton and ROSAT data.},

Previous studies suggested that the planet enhances the magnetic activity of the parent star, producing a chromospheric hot spot which rotates in phase with the planet orbit. However, this phenomenon is intermittent since it was observed in several but not all seasons. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: A long-term monitoring of the magnetic activity of {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}HD 179949{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} is required to study the amplitude and time scales of star-planet interactions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: In 2009 we performed a simultaneous optical and X-ray spectroscopic campaign to monitor the magnetic activity of {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}HD 179949{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} during {\textasciitilde}5 orbital periods and {\textasciitilde}2 stellar rotations. We analyzed the Ca ii H\&amp;K lines as a proxy for chromospheric activity, and we studied the X-ray emission in search of flux modulations and to determine basic properties of the coronal plasma. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: A detailed analysis of the flux in the cores of the Ca ii H\&amp;K lines and a similar study of the X-ray photometry shows evidence of source variability, including one flare. The analysis of the time series of chromospheric data indicates a modulation with a {\textasciitilde}11 days period, compatible with the stellar rotation period at high latitudes. Instead, the X-ray light curve suggests a signal with a period of {\textasciitilde}4 days, consistent with the presence of two active regions on opposite hemispheres. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The observed variability can be explained, most likely, as due to rotational modulation and to intrinsic evolution of chromospheric and coronal activity. There is no clear signature related to the orbital motion of the planet, but the possibility that just a fraction of the chromospheric and coronal variability is modulated with the orbital period of the planet, or the stellar-planet beat period, cannot be excluded. We conclude that any effect due to the presence of the planet is difficult to disentangle.},

Here, we analyze DQ Tau’s light curves obtained by Kepler K2, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and ground-based facilities. We observed variability phenomena, including rotational modulation by stellar spots, brief brightening events due to stellar flares, long brightening events around periastron due to increased accretion, and short dips due to brief circumstellar obscuration. The rotational modulation appears as a sinusoidal variation with a period of 3.017 days. In our model, this is caused by extended stellar spots 400 K colder than the stellar effective temperature. During our 80 day long monitoring, we detected 40 stellar flares with energies up to 1.2 × 1035 erg and duration of a few hours. The flare profiles closely resemble those in older late-type stars, and their occurrence does not correlate with either the rotational or the orbital period. We observe elevated accretion rates of up to 5 × 10-8 M ⊙ yr-1 around each periastron. Our Spitzer data suggest that the increased accretion luminosity temporarily heats up the inner part of the circumbinary disk by about 100 K. We found an inner disk radius of 0.13 au, significantly smaller than expected from dynamical modeling of circumbinary disks. Interestingly, the inner edge of the disk corotates with the binary’s orbit. DQ Tau also shows short dips of {\textless}0.1 mag in its light curve, reminiscent of the well-known “dipper phenomenon” observed in many low-mass young stars.},

Analysis of samples with different spectral types confirmed that the activity fraction of stars with later spectral type clearly decreases as the absolute Galactic height increases away from the Galactic plane. The results also show that at the same absolute Galactic height, the activity fractions in eclipsing binaries are higher than those in single stars. In this study, we present the activity-rotation relations for F-, G-, K-, and M-type variable stars. The results of analysis show that rapid rotators keep a saturated value, and the absolute value of the power-law index exhibits an increasing trend from F- to K-type stars in the unsaturated regime. Moreover, we confirm that the angular momentum and magnetic momentum are positively correlated, which indicates that the α-ω dynamo may be working.

All of these binary systems have Algol-type orbital configurations. The primary components are mostly of the early M-type dwarfs (M0-M3). Even though the occurrence rate of large flares with energy {\textgreater}1034 erg of the EBs is less than the hyperflaring M dwarfs, the corresponding cumulative flare frequency is in general about a factor of 10 higher than the single M dwarfs with flare activity. This might be the consequence of magnetic interaction between the primary and secondary component of individual binaries. The slow rotators are not as active as the fast rotators, some of which display a possible eclipsing effect in their flare activity.},

	abstract = {Among young binary stars whose magnetospheres are expected to collide, only two systems have been observed near periastron in the X-ray band: the low-mass DQ Tau and the older and more massive HD 152404. Both exhibit elevated levels of X-ray emission at periastron. Our goal is to determine whether colliding magnetospheres in young high-eccentricity binaries commonly produce elevated average levels of X-ray activity. This work is based on Chandra snapshots of multiple periastron and non-periastron passages in four nearby young eccentric binaries (Parenago 523, RX J1622.7-2325 Nw, UZ Tau E, and HD 152404). We find that for the merged sample of all four binaries the current X-ray data show an increasing average X-ray flux near periastron (at a ∼2.5-sigma level). Further comparison of these data with the X-ray properties of hundreds of young stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster, produced by the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), indicates that the X-ray emission from the merged sample of our binaries cannot be explained within the framework of the COUP-like X-ray activity. However, due to the inhomogeneities of the merged binary sample and the relatively low statistical significance of the detected flux increase, these findings are regarded as tentative only. More data are needed to prove that the flux increase is real and is related to the processes of colliding magnetospheres.},

We present the light curve of a rarely before observed millimeter flare originating in the region around a pre-main-sequence star, and the first from a classical T Tauri star. We discuss the properties and nature of the flaring behavior in the context of pulsed accretion flows (the current picture based largely on studies of this object's optically variable spectrum), as well as magnetospheric re-connection models (a separate theory that predicts millimeter flares for close binaries of high orbital eccentricity). We believe that the flare mechanism is linked to the binary orbit, and therefore periodic. DQ Tau makes a strong case for multi-wavelength follow-up studies, performed in parallel, of future flares to help determine whether magnetospheric and dynamical interactions in a proto-binary system are independent.},

All four systems have late-type components, and all were known to display radio flaring activity. The primary aim of the campaign was to determine the timescales for flaring activity in these systems. The radio continuum flux at 2.3 and 8.3 GHz was monitored with the NRAO-Green Bank Interferometer from 1995 January to 2000 October. The survey spanned 2096 days with interruptions during maintenance runs and temporary closings of the interferometer. Many strong flares were detected with continuum fluxes at 8.3 GHz as high as 1.17 Jy in β Per, 1.44 Jy in V711 Tau, and 0.82 Jy in UX Ari. Only two flares were detected from δ Lib during 1123 days of monitoring, and the continuum flux reached a maximum of only 0.034 Jy at 8.3 GHz. The independent techniques of Power Spectrum Analysis and Phase Dispersion Minimization were used to determine the periodicity of flaring activity in each binary. The strongest periodicities found were 48.9+/-1.7 days for β Per, 120.7+/-3.4 days for V711 Tau, and 141.4+/-4.5 days for UX Ari, with other significant periodicities of 80.8+/-2.5 days for V711 Tau and 52.6+/-0.7 days for UX Ari. In the case of δ Lib, the strongest periodicities were related to the duration of the two monitoring cycles within the data set and are not real. The continuous survey has demonstrated that there are active and quiescent flaring cycles in V711 Tau and β Per. During both of these cycles, β Per had more flares than V711 Tau, but its strongest flares were typically weaker than those of V711 Tau.},

	abstract = {The solar 0.5 8 Å soft X-ray flux was monitored by the NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) from 1974 to the present, providing a continuous record over two solar activity cycles. Attempts have been made to determine a soft X-ray (SXR) background flux by subtracting out solar flares (using the daily lowest flux level). The SXR background flux represents the quiescent SXR flux from heated plasma in active regions, and reflects similar (intermediate-term) variability and periodicities (e.g. 155-day period) as the SXR or hard X-ray (HXR) flare rate, although it is determined in non-flaring time intervals. The SXR background flux peaks late in Solar Cycle 21 (2 3 years after the sunspot maximum), similar to the flare rate measured in SXR, HXR, or gamma rays, possibly due the increasing complexity of coronal magnetic structures in the decay phase of the solar cycle. The SXR background flux appears to be dominated by postflare emission from the dominant active regions, while the contributions from the quiet Sun are appreciable in the Solar Minimum only (A1-level). Comparisons with full-disk integrated images from YOHKOH suggest that the presence of coronal holes can decrease the quietest SXR irradiance level by an additional order of magnitude, but only in the rare case of absence of active regions.},

	abstract = {Solar activity covers a range of phenomena at all levels in the solar atmosphere and time - scales ranging from seconds and minutes, through months, to the 11 or 22-year solar activity cycle. According to new observations immense cracks sometimes develop in Earth's magnetosphere and remain open for hours during the bed Space Weather conditions. This is usually happen in the course of solar cycle maximum. Highly variable conditions in the geospace environment and those on the sun persist throughout the maximum phase of solar activity. Being able to express aspects of that activity in terms of single indices is useful investigating its role as a driver for various space and terrestrial phenomena. Many studies in the solar-terrestrial field classified solar flares as one of the most important solar events affecting the Earth. To describe that aspect of activity for the sun as a whole the authors continue to compile the daily flare index for solar cycle 23 using the tables of solar flares from the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC). A brief description and final results of the flare index of solar activity for cycle 23 are given. The patterns of similar activity indices that arise under different physical conditions during cycle 23 are compared with the flare index. The north-south asymmetry of CME's, sunspot number, sunspot area and flare index were studied. The intermediate-term periodicities in the daily flare index data for the northern and southern hemisphere were calculated using the Fourier transform, and it was found that 64, 83, 125 days periodicities are in operation during the maximum phase of solar cycle 23.},

I put forth the claim that while humanity’s greatest immediate challenge is to survive the next century or two, our greatest achievement will be eventually greening the universe and bringing it to life.

Observations were gathered by Ichimura and Shimizu over a total monitoring time of 907 hours distributed over 18 years (1971 to 1988). Period analysis of flare activity was performed, and no periodicity was detected on the three stars for either the flare number rate or the energy rate in time-scales ranging from a year up to 14 years. Average colour of flares at peak was (U-B)=-0.98±0.17 and (B-V)=0.05±0.13. Cumulative number distributions of flare event time-integrated energies were solved by a least-squares method on a log-log plot for a power-law function to get both the constant of and the gradient β, which were found to be similar among the three stars. The gradient showed that rare large flare events radiate most of the energy released by all the flare events in the monitoring time. The flare number rate and energy rate are similar if the power-law distributions are extended up to a specific maximum energy. In reality, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that the observed cumulative number distributions of flare event energy were not necessarily a power-law function. The monte-Carlo simulation, however, indicates that the monitoring time and/or the patrol observation time interval may not be long enough to get the average flare number rate and energy rate, especially at the upper energy limits which are statistically unreliable.},

Many theories have been proposed to explain their radius inflation and several suggest that a small fraction of the incident starlight is injected into the planetary interior, which helps to puff up the planet. How will such energy injection affect the planetary dynamo? In this Letter, we estimate the surface magnetic field strength of hot Jupiters using scaling arguments that relate energy available in planetary interiors to the dynamo-generated magnetic fields. We find that if we take into account the energy injected in the planetary interior that is sufficient to inflate hot Jupiters to observed radii, then the resulting dynamo should be able generate magnetic fields that are more than an order of magnitude stronger than the Jovian values. Our analysis highlights the potential fundamental role of the stellar light in setting the field strength in hot Jupiters.},

We simulate Gaia observations of stars with 10 year activity cycles to search for evidence of activity cycles, and find that Gaia astrometry alone likely cannot detect activity cycles for stars in the TGAS sample, even if they have spot distributions like KIC 7174505. We review the activity of the nearby low-mass stars in the TGAS sample for which we anticipate significant detections of spot-induced jitter.},

	abstract = {Assuming only that flares derive their energy from a coronal source and that flaring is the dominant mechanism for depleting that source, the global coronal response time (time for flares to remove available coronal energy) is about 9 months. A detailed model for dynamic energy balance in the solar corona over the solar cycle is presented to describe how the magnetic free energy in the solar corona varies in response to changes in the supply of energy to the system and to changes in the flaring rate. The model predicts that both the flaring rate and the free energy of the system should lag behind the driving of the system because of the coronal response time (the detailed model gives a lag of 11 months). This effect may account for hysteresis phenomena between certain solar activity indices. A specific example is presented in support of the model. Analysis of time series of monthly sunspot numbers and monthly numbers of soft X-ray flares over the years 1976-1999 indicates a tendency for flare numbers to lag behind sunspot numbers by 6 months.},

Herein we report the discovery of 10 rapidly rotating M dwarfs with highly structured rotational modulation patterns among 371 M dwarfs found to have rotation periods less than 1 day. Starspot models cannot explain the highly structured periodic variations that typically exhibit between 10 and 40 Fourier harmonics. A similar set of objects was previously reported following K2 observations of the Upper Scorpius association. We examine the possibility that the unusual structured light curves could stem from absorption by charged dust particles that are trapped in or near the stellar magnetosphere. We also briefly explore the possibilities that the sharp structured features in the light curves are produced by extinction by coronal gas, by beaming of the radiation emitted from the stellar surface, or by occultations of spots by a dusty ring that surrounds the star. The last is perhaps the most promising of these scenarios. Most of the structured rotators display flaring activity, and we investigate changes in the modulation pattern following the largest flares. As part of this study, we also report the discovery of 17 rapidly rotating M dwarfs with rotational periods below 4 hr, of which the shortest period is 1.63 hr.},

The oscillation is well approximated by an exponentially decaying harmonic function. The period of the oscillation is found to be 32 minutes, the decay time about 46 minutes, and the relative amplitude 15\%. As this observational signature is typical of the longitudinal oscillations observed in solar flares at extreme ultraviolet and radio wavelengths, associated with standing slow magnetoacoustic waves, we suggest that this megaflare may be of a similar nature. In this scenario, macroscopic variations of the plasma parameters in the oscillations modulate the ejection of non-thermal electrons. The phase speed of the longitudinal (slow magnetoacoustic) waves in the flaring loop or arcade, the tube speed, of about 230 km s-1 would require a loop length of about 200 Mm. Other mechanisms, such as standing kink oscillations, are also considered.},

After the saturation phase, we find L XUV decayed over time by an exponential rate of β XUV . Compared to our inferred age of the system, Gyr, our result for t sat suggests that there is only a ∼4\% chance that TRAPPIST-1 still remains in the saturated phase today, which is significantly lower than the previous estimate of 40\%. Despite this reduction in t sat, our results remain consistent in the conclusion that the TRAPPIST-1 planets likely received an extreme amount XUV energy—an estimated integrated XUV energy of ∼1030–1032 erg over the star’s lifetime.},

We report an updated bolometric luminosity (Lbol) of −3.216 ± 0.016, along with semiempirical fundamental parameters: effective temperature Teff = 2628 ± 42 K, mass = 90 ± 8 MJup, radius = 1.16 ± 0.03 RJup, and log g = 5.21 ± 0.06 dex. Its kinematics point toward an older age, while spectral indices indicate youth; therefore, we compare the overall SED and NIR bands of TRAPPIST-1 to field-age, low-gravity, and low-metallicity dwarfs of similar Teff and Lbol. We find field dwarfs of similar Teff and Lbol best fit the overall and band-by-band features of TRAPPIST-1. Additionally, we present new Allers \& Liu spectral indices for the SpeX SXD and FIRE spectra of TRAPPIST-1, both classifying it as intermediate gravity. Examining Teff, Lbol, and absolute JHKW1W2 magnitudes versus optical spectral type places TRAPPIST-1 in an ambiguous location containing both field and intermediate-gravity sources. Kinematics place TRAPPIST-1 within a subpopulation of intermediate-gravity sources lacking bona fide membership in a moving group with higher tangential and UVW velocities. We conclude that TRAPPIST-1 is a field-age source with subtle spectral features reminiscent of a low surface gravity object. To resolve the cause of TRAPPIST-1's intermediate-gravity indicators we speculate on two avenues that might be correlated to inflate the radius: (1) magnetic activity or (2) tidal interactions from planets. We find the M8 dwarf LHS 132 is an excellent match to TRAPPIST-1's spectral peculiarities along with the M9 β dwarf 2MASS J10220489+0200477, the L1 β 2MASS J10224821+5825453, and the L0 β 2MASS J23224684−3133231, which have distinct kinematics, making all four intriguing targets for future exoplanet studies.},

We collate empirical age constraints based on the color-absolute magnitude diagram, average density, lithium absorption, surface gravity features, metallicity, kinematics, rotation, and magnetic activity; and conclude that TRAPPIST-1 is a transitional thin/thick disk star with an age of 7.6 ± 2.2 Gyr. The star’s color–magnitude position indicates that it is slightly metal-rich, which is consistent with the previously reported near-infrared spectroscopic metallicity; and it has a radius ) that is larger by 8\%–14\% than the predictions of solar-metallicity evolutionary models.

TRAPPIST-1 is an active star with frequent flaring, with implications for the habitability of its planets. Superflares (stellar flares whose energy exceeds 1033 erg) can completely destroy the atmospheres of a cool star's planets, allowing ultraviolet radiation and high-energy particles to bombard their surfaces. However, ultracool dwarfs emit little ultraviolet flux when quiescent, raising the possibility of frequent flares being necessary for prebiotic chemistry that requires ultraviolet light. We combine Evryscope and Kepler observations to characterize the high-energy flare rate of TRAPPIST-1. The Evryscope is an array of 22 small telescopes imaging the entire Southern sky in g' every two minutes. Evryscope observations, spanning 170 nights over 2 yr, complement the 80 day continuous short-cadence K2 observations by sampling TRAPPIST-1's long-term flare activity. We update TRAPPIST-1's superflare rate, finding a cumulative rate of \$\{4.2\}\_\{-0.2\}{\textasciicircum}\{+1.9\}\$ superflares per year. We calculate the flare rate necessary to deplete ozone in the habitable-zone planets' atmospheres, and find that TRAPPIST-1's flare rate is insufficient to deplete ozone if present on its planets. In addition, we calculate the flare rate needed to provide enough ultraviolet flux to power prebiotic chemistry. We find TRAPPIST-1's flare rate is likely insufficient to catalyze some of the Earthlike chemical pathways thought to lead to ribonucleic acid synthesis, and flux due to flares in the biologically relevant UV-B band is orders of magnitude less for any TRAPPIST-1 planet than has been experienced by Earth at any time in its history.},

	abstract = {While Jupiter's massive gas envelope consists mainly of hydrogen and helium, the key to understanding Jupiter's formation and evolution lies in the distribution of the remaining (heavy) elements. Before the Juno mission, the lack of high-precision gravity harmonics precluded the use of statistical analyses in a robust determination of the heavy-elements distribution in Jupiter's envelope. In this paper, we assemble the most comprehensive and diverse collection of Jupiter interior models to date and use it to study the distribution of heavy elements in the planet's envelope. We apply a Bayesian statistical approach to our interior model calculations, reproducing the Juno gravitational and atmospheric measurements and constraints from the deep zonal flows. Our results show that the gravity constraints lead to a deep entropy of Jupiter corresponding to a 1 bar temperature 5-15 K higher than traditionally assumed. We also find that uncertainties in the equation of state are crucial when determining the amount of heavy elements in Jupiter's interior. Our models put an upper limit to the inner compact core of Jupiter of 7 Earth masses, independently on the structure model (with or without dilute core) and the equation of state considered. Furthermore, we robustly demonstrate that Jupiter's envelope is inhomogenous, with a heavy-element enrichment in the interior relative to the outer envelope. This implies that heavy element enrichment continued through the gas accretion phase, with important implications for the formation of giant planets in our solar system and beyond.},

	abstract = {Exoplanets in extremely close-in orbits are immersed in a local interplanetary medium (i.e. the stellar wind) much denser than the local conditions encountered around the Solar system planets. The environment surrounding these exoplanets also differs in terms of dynamics (slower stellar winds, but higher Keplerian velocities) and ambient magnetic fields (likely higher for host stars more active than the Sun). Here, we quantitatively investigate the nature of the interplanetary media surrounding the hot Jupiters HD 46375b, HD 73256b, HD 102195b, HD 130322b and HD 179949b. We simulate the three-dimensional winds of their host stars, in which we directly incorporate their observed surface magnetic fields. With that, we derive mass-loss rates (1.9-8.0 × 10-13 M⊙ yr-1) and the wind properties at the position of the hot Jupiters' orbits (temperature, velocity, magnetic field intensity and pressure). We show that these exoplanets' orbits are supermagnetosonic, indicating that bow shocks are formed surrounding these planets. Assuming planetary magnetic fields similar to Jupiter's, we estimate planetary magnetospheric sizes of 4.1-5.6 planetary radii. We also derive the exoplanetary radio emission released in the dissipation of the stellar wind energy. We find radio fluxes ranging from 0.02 to 0.13 mJy, which are challenging to be observed with present-day technology, but could be detectable with future higher sensitivity arrays (e.g. Square Kilometre Array). Radio emission from systems having closer hot Jupiters, such as from τ Boo b or HD 189733b, or from nearby planetary systems orbiting young stars, are likely to have higher radio fluxes, presenting better prospects for detecting exoplanetary radio emission.},

Therefore, some of them may appear as interesting candidates for the target star lists of terrestrial exoplanet (i.e., planets with mass, radius, and internal parameters identical to Earth) search programs like Darwin (ESA) or the Terrestrial Planet Finder Coronagraph/Inferometer (NASA). The higher level of stellar activity of low mass M stars, as compared to solar-like G stars, as well as the closer orbital distances of their habitable zones (HZs), means that terrestrial-type exoplanets within HZs of these stars are more influenced by stellar activity than one would expect for a planet in an HZ of a solar-like star. Here we examine the influences of stellar coronal mass ejection (CME) activity on planetary environments and the role CMEs may play in the definition of habitability criterion for the terrestrial type exoplanets near M stars. We pay attention to the fact that exoplanets within HZs that are in close proximity to low mass M stars may become tidally locked, which, in turn, can result in relatively weak intrinsic planetary magnetic moments. Taking into account existing observational data and models that involve the Sun and related hypothetical parameters of extrasolar CMEs (density, velocity, size, and occurrence rate), we show that Earth-like exoplanets within close-in HZs should experience a continuous CME exposure over long periods of time. This fact, together with small magnetic moments of tidally locked exoplanets, may result in little or no magnetospheric protection of planetary atmospheres from a dense flow of CME plasma. Magnetospheric standoff distances of weakly magnetized Earth-like exoplanets at orbital distances {\textless}=0.1 AU can be shrunk, under the action of CMEs, to altitudes of about 1,000 km above the planetary surface. Such compressed magnetospheres may have crucial consequences for atmospheric erosion processes.

	abstract = {Past studies addressing the thermal atmospheric escape of hydrogen from ``hot Jupiters'' have been based on the planet's effective temperature, which, as we show here, is not physically relevant for loss processes. In consequence, these studies led to significant underestimations of the atmospheric escape rate ({\textless}=103 g s-1) and to the conclusion of long-term atmospheric stability. From more realistic exospheric temperatures, determined from X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) irradiation and thermal conduction in the thermosphere, we find that energy-limited escape and atmospheric expansion arise, leading to much higher estimations for the loss rates ({\textasciitilde}1012 g s-1). These fluxes are in good agreement with recent determinations for HD 209458b based on observations of its extended exosphere. We also show that for young solar-type stars, which emit stronger XUV fluxes, the inferred loss rates are significantly higher. Thus, hydrogen-rich giant exoplanets under such strong XUV irradiances may evaporate down to their core sizes or shrink to levels at which heavier atmospheric constituents may prevent hydrodynamic escape. These results could explain the apparent paucity of exoplanets so far detected at orbital distances less than 0.04 AU.},

	abstract = {The ubiquity of M dwarfs, combined with the relative ease of detecting terrestrial-mass planets around them, has made them prime targets for finding and characterizing planets in the `habitable zone' (HZ). However, Kepler finds that terrestrial-mass exoplanets are often born with voluminous H/He envelopes, comprising mass-fractions (Menv/Mcore) ≳1 per cent. If these planets retain such envelopes over Gyr time-scales, they will not be `habitable' even within the HZ. Given the strong X-ray/UV fluxes of M dwarfs, we study whether sufficient envelope mass can be photoevaporated away for these planets to become habitable. We improve upon previous work by using hydrodynamic models that account for radiative cooling as well as the transition from hydrodynamic to ballistic escape. Adopting a template active M dwarf XUV spectrum, including stellar evolution, and considering both evaporation and thermal evolution, we show that: (1) the mass-loss is (considerably) lower than previous estimates that use an `energy-limited' formalism and ignore the transition to Jeans escape; (2) at the inner edge of the HZ, planets with core mass ≲ 0.9 M⊕ can lose enough H/He to become habitable if their initial envelope mass-fraction is ∼1 per cent; (3) at the outer edge of the HZ, evaporation cannot remove a ∼1 per cent H/He envelope even from cores down to 0.8 M⊕. Thus, if planets form with bulky H/He envelopes, only those with low-mass cores may eventually be habitable. Cores ≳1 M⊕, with ≳1 per cent natal H/He envelopes, will not be habitable in the HZ of M dwarfs.},

The extreme irradiation levels that these atmospheres experience cause them to undergo hydrodynamic atmospheric escape. Ongoing atmospheric escape has been observed to be occurring in a few nearby exoplanet systems through transit spectroscopy both for hot Jupiters and for lower-mass super-Earths and mini-Neptunes. Detailed hydrodynamic calculations that incorporate radiative transfer and ionization chemistry are now common in one-dimensional models, and multidimensional calculations that incorporate magnetic fields and interactions with the interstellar environment are cutting edge. However, comparison between simulations and observations remains very limited. While hot Jupiters experience atmospheric escape, the mass-loss rates are not high enough to affect their evolution. However, for lower-mass planets, atmospheric escape drives and controls their evolution, sculpting the exoplanet population that we observe today.},

While photon interactions with planetary atmospheres and outflows have been researched to some degree, studies of stellar wind interactions are in their infancy. Here, we use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to model the effect of the stellar wind on the magnetosphere and outflow of a hypothetical planet, modeled to have an H-rich evaporating envelope with a prescribed mass-loss rate, orbiting in the habitable zone close to a low-mass M dwarf. We take the TRAPPIST-1 system as a prototype, with our simulated planet situated at the orbit of TRAPPIST-1e. We show that the atmospheric outflow is accelerated and advected upon interaction with the wind, resulting in a diverse range of planetary magnetosphere morphologies and plasma distributions as local stellar wind conditions change along the orbit. We consider the implications of the wind-outflow interaction on potential hydrogen Lyα observations of the planetary atmosphere during transits. The Lyα observational signatures depend strongly on the local wind conditions at the time of the observation and can be subject to considerable variation on timescales as short as an hour. Our results indicate that observed variations in exoplanet transit signatures could be explained by wind-outflow interaction.},

	abstract = {At fast rotation rates, the coronal activity of G- and K-type stars has been observed to 'saturate' and then decline again at even faster rotation rates - a phenomenon dubbed 'supersaturation'. In this paper, we investigate coronal activity in fast-rotating M-dwarfs using deep XMM-Newton observations of 97 low-mass stars of known rotation period in the young open cluster NGC 2547 and combine these with published X-ray surveys of low-mass field and cluster stars of known rotation period. Like G- and K-dwarfs, we find that M-dwarfs exhibit increasing coronal activity with decreasing Rossby number NR, the ratio of period to convective turnover time, and that activity saturates at LX/Lbol≃ 10-3 for log NR {\textless} -0.8. However, supersaturation is not convincingly displayed by M-dwarfs, despite the presence of many objects in our sample with log NR {\textless} -1.8, where supersaturation is observed to occur in higher mass stars. Instead, it appears that a short rotation period is the primary predictor of supersaturation; P ≤ 0.3 d for K-dwarfs and perhaps P ≤ 0.2 d for M-dwarfs. These observations favour the 'centrifugal stripping' model for supersaturation, where coronal structures are forced open or become radiatively unstable as the Keplerian corotation radius moves inside the X-ray-emitting coronal volume.},

The model is compared with observational data for highly magnetically active M-dwarfs in the young cluster NGC 2516. We find that the best-fitting starspot scalelength is not constrained by these data alone, but requires assumptions about the overall starspot-filling factor and starspot temperature. Assuming a spot coverage fraction of 0.4 ± 0.1 and a starspot to unspotted photosphere temperature ratio of 0.7 ± 0.05, as suggested by the inflated radii of these stars compared to evolutionary model predictions and by TiO band measurements on other active cool stars of earlier spectral type, the best-fitting starspot angular scalelength is 3.5+ 2− 1 degrees, or a linear scalelength of ∼25 000 km. This linear scalelength is similar to large sunspot groups, but two to five times smaller than the starspots recently deduced on an active G-dwarf using eclipse mapping by a transiting exoplanet. However, the best-fitting spot scalelength in the NGC 2516 M-dwarfs increases with the assumed spot temperature ratio and with the inverse square root of the assumed spot-filling factor. Hence, the light-curve amplitude distribution might equally well be described by these larger spot scalelengths if the spot-filling factors are \&lt;0.1 or the spot temperature ratio is \&gt;0.9.},

Flares, energetic eruptions on the surfaces of stars, are an unmistakable manifestation of magnetically driven emission. The occurrence rates and energy distributions of flares trace stellar characteristics such as mass and age. However, before flares can be used to constrain stellar properties, the flaring-age-mass relation requires proper calibration. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: This work sets out to quantify the flaring activity of independently age-dated main sequence stars for a broad range of spectral types using optical light curves obtained by the Kepler satellite. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Drawing from the complete K2 archive, we searched 3435 ∼80 day long light curves of 2111 open cluster members for flares using the open-source software packages K2SC to remove instrumental and astrophysical variability from K2 light curves, and AltaiPony to search and characterize the flare candidates. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We confirmed a total of 3844 flares on high probability open cluster members with ages from zero age main sequence (Pleiades) to 3.6 Gyr (M 67). We extended the mass range probed in the first study of this series to span from Sun-like stars to mid-M dwarfs. We added the Hyades (690 Myr) to the sample as a comparison cluster to Praesepe (750 Myr), the 2.6 Gyr old Ruprecht 147, and several hundred light curves from the late K2 Campaigns in the remaining clusters. We found that the flare energy distribution was similar in the entire parameter space, following a power law relation with exponent α ≈ 1.84-2.39. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We confirm that flaring rates decline with age, and decline faster for higher mass stars. Our results are in good agreement with most previous statistical flare studies. We find evidence that a rapid decline in flaring activity occurred in M1-M2 dwarfs around the ages of the Hyades and Praesepe, when these stars spun down to rotation periods of about 10 d, while higher mass stars had already transitioned to lower flaring rates and lower mass stars still resided in the saturated activity regime. We conclude that some discrepancies between our results and flare studies that used rotation periods for their age estimates could be explained by sample selection bias toward more active stars, but others may point to the limitations of using rotation as an age indicator without additional constraints from stellar activity. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Full Tables 2 and 3, and a table of properties derived for the 2111 stars in this study are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/645/A42"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/645/A42{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The Sun and Sun-like stars commonly host multimillion-kelvin coronae and 10,000 K chromospheres. These extremely hot gases generate X-ray and extreme ultraviolet emissions that may impact the erosion and chemistry of (exo)planetary atmospheres, influencing the climate and conditions for habitability. However, the mechanism of coronal and chromospheric heating is still poorly understood. While the magnetic field most probably plays a key role in driving and transporting energy from the stellar surface upwards, it is not clear whether the atmospheric heating mechanisms of the Sun and active Sun-like stars can be described in a unified manner. To this end, we report on a systematic survey of the responses of solar and stellar atmospheres to surface magnetic flux over a wide range of temperatures. By analyzing 10 years of multiwavelength synoptic observations of the Sun, we reveal that the irradiance and magnetic flux show power-law relations with an exponent decreasing from above unity to below as the temperature decreases from the corona to the chromosphere. Moreover, this trend indicating the efficiency of atmospheric heating can be extended to Sun-like stars. We also discover that the power-law exponent depends on the solar cycle, becoming smallest at maximum activity, probably due to the saturation of atmospheric heating. Our study provides observational evidence that the mechanism of atmospheric heating is universal among the Sun and Sun-like stars, regardless of age or activity.},

The Ca II K line core intensity is transformed to a Ca II H + K line core flux density to facilitate a comparison of solar and stellar data. A new absolute calibration for the Mount Wilson Ca II H + K fluxes for G-type dwarfs is derived. The minimum Ca II K flux, found in the centers of supergranulation cells in quiet regions on the sun, is identical to the minimum flux that is observed for solar-type stars.

Standard stellar structure codes suggest that Mcc is in the range 0.3-0.4 Msolar. In the present paper we examine several nonstandard additions to stellar structure in order to quantify their effects on the value of Mcc. We find that by including magnetic field effects, Mcc may fall to values that are significantly smaller than the standard range. This result is of interest in understanding why coronae and chromospheres in active M dwarfs fail to exhibit detectable alterations at spectral class M3-M4. The structural properties of our magnetic models also explain why active M dwarfs tend to have radii that are larger than expected for their Teff values or Teff values that are too low for their radii. Our results lead us to predict that certain stars that are classified as late L or T stars may actually have masses of 0.1-0.15 Msolar.},

We take inspiration from recent progress in understanding solar wind acceleration to develop a physically motivated model of the time-steady mass loss rates of cool main-sequence stars and evolved giants. This model follows the energy flux of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence from a subsurface convection zone to its eventual dissipation and escape through open magnetic flux tubes. We show how Alfvén waves and turbulence can produce winds in either a hot corona or a cool extended chromosphere, and we specify the conditions that determine whether or not coronal heating occurs. These models do not utilize arbitrary normalization factors, but instead predict the mass loss rate directly from a star's fundamental properties. We take account of stellar magnetic activity by extending standard age-activity-rotation indicators to include the evolution of the filling factor of strong photospheric magnetic fields. We compared the predicted mass loss rates with observed values for 47 stars and found significantly better agreement than was obtained from the popular scaling laws of Reimers, Schröder, and Cuntz. The algorithm used to compute cool-star mass loss rates is provided as a self-contained and efficient computer code. We anticipate that the results from this kind of model can be incorporated straightforwardly into stellar evolution calculations and population synthesis techniques.},

	abstract = {On 13 March 1989, the largest magnetic storm of the last century caused widespread effects on power systems including a blackout of the Hydro-Québec system. Since then this event has become the archetypal disturbance for examining the geomagnetic hazard to power systems. However, even 30 years on from 1989, the story of exactly what happened in March 1989 is far from complete. This paper reexamines the information available about the March 1989 event and uses this to construct a timeline and description of the space weather phenomena and how they caused the power system effects. The evidence shows that the disturbance was caused by two coronal mass ejections (CMEs): the first associated with a X4.5 flare on 10 March and the second linked to a M7.3 flare on 12 March. The arrival of the interplanetary CME shock fronts caused storm sudden commencements at 01.27 and 07.43 UT on 13 March. The transit time and speed of the first (second) interplanetary CME shock are 54.5 hr (31.5 hr) and 760 km/s (1,320 km/s). Empirical relations are used to estimate solar wind speed and southward interplanetary magnetic field, Bs, and give values of v = 980 km/s, Bs = 40 to 60 nT at the peak of the storm. Key findings are that the second storm sudden commencement occurred at the same time as the substorm that impacted the Hydro-Québec system and indicates that external triggering of the substorm may have contributed to a faster substorm onset than might otherwise have occurred. This caused the production of larger geomagnetically induced currents that caused the Hydro-Québec blackout. The March 1989 storm had the largest recorded value of the Dst index representing the size of the magnetic storm main phase, but the Hydro-Québec blackout occurred early in the storm when the Dst value was less disturbed. Only later in the storm did Dst reach its peak value. At this time an expansion of the auroral oval brought disturbances to lower latitudes where they caused power system problems in the United States, United Kingdom, and Sweden.},

	abstract = {Liquid water oceans are at the center of our search for life on exoplanets because water is a strict requirement for life as we know it. However, oceans are dynamic habitats—and some oceans may be better hosts for life than others. In Earth’s ocean, circulation transports essential nutrients such as phosphate and is a first-order control on the distribution and productivity of life. Of particular importance is upward flow from the dark depths of the ocean in response to wind-driven divergence in surface layers. This “upwelling” returns essential nutrients that tend to accumulate at depth via sinking of organic particulates back to the sunlit regions where photosynthetic life thrives. Ocean dynamics are likely to impose constraints on the activity and atmospheric expression of photosynthetic life in exo-oceans as well, but we lack an understanding of how ocean dynamics may differ on other planets. We address this issue by exploring the sensitivity of ocean dynamics to a suite of planetary parameters using ROCKE-3D, a fully coupled ocean–atmosphere general circulation model. Our results suggest that planets that rotate slower and have higher surface pressure than Earth may be the most attractive targets for remote life detection because upwelling is enhanced under these conditions, resulting in greater nutrient supply to the surface biosphere. Seasonal deepening of the mixed layer on high-obliquity planets may also enhance nutrient replenishment from depth into the surface mixed layer. Efficient nutrient recycling favors greater biological activity, more biosignature production, and thus more detectable life. More generally, our results demonstrate the importance of considering oceanographic phenomena for exoplanet life detection and motivate future interdisciplinary contributions to the emerging field of exo-oceanography.},

	abstract = {Estimating stellar ages is important for advancing our understanding of stellar and exoplanet evolution and investigating the history of the Milky Way. However, ages for low-mass stars are hard to infer as they evolve slowly on the main sequence. In addition, empirical dating methods are difficult to calibrate for low-mass stars as they are faint. In this work, we calculate ages for Kepler F, G, and crucially K and M dwarfs, using their rotation and kinematic properties. We apply the simple assumption that the velocity dispersion of stars increases over time and adopt an age-velocity-dispersion relation (AVR) to estimate average stellar ages for groupings of coeval stars. We calculate the vertical velocity dispersion of stars in bins of absolute magnitude, temperature, rotation period, and Rossby number and then convert velocity dispersion to kinematic age via an AVR. Using this method, we estimate gyro-kinematic ages for 29,949 Kepler stars with measured rotation periods. We are able to estimate ages for clusters and asteroseismic stars with an rms of 1.22 Gyr and 0.26 Gyr respectively. With our Astraea machine-learning algorithm, which predicts rotation periods, we suggest a new selection criterion (a weight of 0.15) to increase the size of the McQuillan et al. catalog of Kepler rotation periods by up to 25\%. Using predicted rotation periods, we estimated gyro-kinematic ages for stars without measured rotation periods and found promising results by comparing 12 detailed age-element abundance trends with literature values.},

This general relation points to an intimate connection between the nonthermal, energetic electrons causing the radio emission and the bulk plasma of the corona responsible for thermal X-rays. The relation, observed over six orders of magnitude, suggests that the heating mechanism necessarily involves particle acceleration. We derive requirements for simple models based on optically thin gyrosynchrotron emission of mildly relativistic electrons and thermal X-rays from the bulk plasma. We discuss the possibility that a portion of the accelerated particles heats the ambient plasma by collisions. More likely, plasma heating and particle acceleration may occur in parallel and in the same process, but at a fixed ratio.},

This braking torque is coupled to the stellar magnetic field, such that changes in the strength and/or geometry of the field modifies the efficiency of this process. Since the space age, we have been able to directly measure solar wind properties using in situ spacecraft. Furthermore, indirect proxies such as sunspot number, geomagnetic indices, and cosmogenic radionuclides, constrain the variation of solar wind properties on centennial and millennial timescales. We use near-Earth measurements of the solar wind plasma and magnetic field to calculate the torque on the Sun throughout the space age. Then, reconstructions of the solar open magnetic flux are used to estimate the time-varying braking torque during the last nine millennia. We assume a relationship for the solar mass-loss rate based on observations during the space age which, due to the weak dependence of the torque on mass-loss rate, does not strongly affect our predicted torque. The average torque during the last nine millennia is found to be 2.2 × 1030 erg, which is comparable to the average value from the last two decades. Our data set includes grand minima (such as the Maunder Minimum), and maxima in solar activity, where the torque varies from ∼1 to 5 × 1030 erg (averaged on decadal timescales), respectively. We find no evidence for any secular variation of the torque on timescales of less than 9000 yr.},

	abstract = {The long-term evolution of the Sun's rotation period cannot be directly observed, and is instead inferred from trends in the measured rotation periods of other Sun-like stars. Assuming the Sun spins down as it ages, following rotation rate ∝ age-1/2, requires the current solar angular momentum (AM) loss rate to be around 6 × 1030 erg. Magnetohydrodynamic models, and previous observations of the solar wind (from the Helios and Wind spacecraft), generally predict a values closer to 1 × 1030 erg or 3 × 1030 erg, respectively. Recently, the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed tangential solar wind speeds as high as ∼50 km s-1 in a localized region of the inner heliosphere. If such rotational flows were prevalent throughout the corona, it would imply that the solar wind AM-loss rate is an order of magnitude larger than all of those previous estimations. In this Letter, we evaluate the AM flux in the solar wind, using data from the first two orbits of PSP. The solar wind is observed to contain both large positive (as seen during perihelion), and negative AM fluxes. We analyze two solar wind streams that were repeatedly traversed by PSP; the first is a slow wind stream whose average AM flux fluctuates between positive and negative values, and the second is an intermediate speed stream that contains a positive AM flux (more consistent with a constant flow of AM). When the data from PSP are evaluated holistically, the average equatorial AM flux implies a global AM-loss rate of around (2.6-4.2) × 1030 erg (which is more consistent with observations from previous spacecraft).},

We demonstrate that this new formulation explains why the lowest mass stars are observed to maintain rapid rotation for much longer than solar-mass stars, and simultaneously why older populations exhibit a sequence of slowly rotating stars, in which the low-mass stars rotate more slowly than solar-mass stars. The model also reproduces some previously unexplained features in the period-mass diagram for the Kepler field, notably: the particular shape of the "upper envelope" of the distribution, suggesting that {\textasciitilde}95\% of Kepler field stars with measured rotation periods are younger than {\textasciitilde}4 Gyr; and the shape of the "lower envelope," corresponding to the location where stars transition between magnetically saturated and unsaturated regimes.},

	abstract = {Nearly half a century has passed since the initial indications that stellar rotation slows while chromospheric activity weakens with a power-law dependence on age, the so-called Skumanich relations. Subsequent characterization of the mass-dependence of this behavior up to the age of the Sun led to the advent of gyrochronology, which uses the rotation rate of a star to infer its age from an empirical calibration. The efficacy of the method relies on predictable angular momentum loss from a stellar wind entrained in the large-scale magnetic field produced by global dynamo action. Recent observational evidence suggests that the global dynamo begins to shut down near the middle of a star’s main-sequence lifetime, leading to a disruption in the production of large-scale magnetic field, a dramatic reduction in angular momentum loss, and a breakdown of gyrochronology relations. For solar-type stars this transition appears to occur near the age of the Sun, when rotation becomes too slow to imprint Coriolis forces on the global convective patterns, reducing the shear induced by differential rotation, and disrupting the large-scale dynamo. We use data from Barnes to reveal the signature of this transition in the observations that were originally used to validate gyrochronology. We propose that chromospheric activity may ultimately provide a more reliable age indicator for older stars, and we suggest that asteroseismology can be used to help calibrate activity-age relations for field stars beyond the middle of their main-sequence lifetimes.},

Although rotation rates from spots can be difficult to determine for older, less active stars, rotational splitting of asteroseismic oscillation frequencies can provide rotation rates for both active and quiescent stars, and so can confirm whether this effect really takes place on the main sequence. We obtained asteroseismic rotation rates of 91 main sequence stars showing high signal-to-noise modes of oscillation. Using these new rotation rates, along with effective temperatures, metallicities and seismic masses and ages, we built a hierarchical Bayesian mixture model to determine whether the ensemble more closely agreed with a standard rotational evolution scenario, or one where weakened magnetic braking takes place. The weakened magnetic braking scenario was found to be 98.4\% more likely for our stellar ensemble, adding to the growing body of evidence for this stage of stellar rotational evolution. This work presents a large catalogue of seismic rotation rates for stars on the main sequence, which opens up possibilities for more detailed ensemble analysis of rotational evolution with Kepler.},

	abstract = {Magnetic activity in Sun-like and low-mass stars causes X-ray coronal emission which is stronger for more rapidly rotating stars. This relation is often interpreted in terms of the Rossby number, i.e., the ratio of rotation period to convective overturn time. We reconsider this interpretation on the basis of the observed X-ray emission and rotation periods of 821 stars with masses below 1.4 M ⊙. A generalized analysis of the relation between X-ray luminosity normalized by bolometric luminosity, L X/L bol, and combinations of rotational period, P, and stellar radius, R, shows that the Rossby formulation does not provide the solution with minimal scatter. Instead, we find that the relation L X/L bolvpropP -2 R -4 optimally describes the non-saturated fraction of the stars. This relation is equivalent to L XvpropP -2, indicating that the rotation period alone determines the total X-ray emission. Since L X is directly related to the magnetic flux at the stellar surface, this means that the surface flux is determined solely by the star's rotation and is independent of other stellar parameters. While a formulation in terms of a Rossby number would be consistent with these results if the convective overturn time scales exactly as L\_bol-1/2, our generalized approach emphasizes the need to test a broader range of mechanisms for dynamo action in cool stars.},

	abstract = {Stellar rotation was proposed as a potential age diagnostic that is precise, simple, and applicable to a broad range of low-mass stars (≤slant 1 \{M\}⊙ ). Unfortunately, rotation period (\{P\}\{\{rot\}\}) measurements of low-mass members of open clusters have undermined the idea that stars spin down with a common age dependence (i.e., \{P\}\{\{rot\}\} {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}sqrt\{age\vphantom{\{}\}\}): K dwarfs appear to spin down more slowly than F and G dwarfs. Agüeros et al. interpreted data for the ≈1.4 Gyr-old cluster NGC 752 differently, proposing that after having converged onto a slow-rotating sequence in their first 600-700 Myr (by the age of Praesepe), K dwarf \{P\}\{\{rot\}\} stall on that sequence for an extended period of time. We use data from Gaia DR2 to identify likely single-star members of the ≈1 Gyr-old cluster NGC 6811 with Kepler light curves. We measure \{P\}\{\{rot\}\} for 171 members, more than doubling the sample relative to the existing catalog and extending the mass limit from ≈ 0.8 to ≈0.6 \{M\}⊙ . We then apply a gyrochronology formula calibrated with Praesepe and the Sun to 27 single G dwarfs in NGC 6811 to derive a precise gyrochronological age for the cluster of 1.04 ± 0.07 Gyr. However, when our new low-mass rotators are included, NGC 6811's color-\{P\}\{\{rot\}\} sequence deviates away from the naive 1 Gyr projection down to \{T\}\{\{eff\}\}≈ 4295 K (K5V, 0.7 \{M\}⊙ ), where it clearly overlaps with Praesepe’s. Combining these data with \{P\}\{\{rot\}\} for other clusters, we conclude that the assumption that mass and age are separable dependencies is invalid. Furthermore, the cluster data show definitively that stars experience a temporary epoch of reduced braking efficiency where \{P\}\{\{rot\}\} stall, and that the duration of this epoch lasts longer for lower-mass stars.},

	abstract = {Stellar rotation is a strong function of both mass and evolutionary state. Missions such as Kepler and CoRoT provide tens of thousands of rotation periods, drawn from stellar populations that contain objects at a range of masses, ages, and evolutionary states. Given a set of reasonable starting conditions and a prescription for angular momentum loss, we address the expected range of rotation periods for cool field stellar populations ({\textasciitilde}0.4-2.0 M ⊙). We find that cool stars fall into three distinct regimes in rotation. Rapid rotators with surface periods less than 10 days are either young low-mass main sequence (MS) stars, or higher mass subgiants which leave the MS with high rotation rates. Intermediate rotators (10-40 days) can be either cool MS dwarfs, suitable for gyrochronology, or crossing subgiants at a range of masses. Gyrochronology relations must therefore be applied cautiously, since there is an abundant population of subgiant contaminants. The slowest rotators, at periods greater than 40 days, are lower mass subgiants undergoing envelope expansion. We identify additional diagnostic uses of rotation periods. There exists a period-age relation for subgiants distinct from the MS period-age relations. There is also a period-radius relation that can be used as a constraint on the stellar radius, particularly in the interesting case of planet host stars. The high-mass/low-mass break in the rotation distribution on the MS persists onto the subgiant branch, and has potential as a diagnostic of stellar mass. Finally, this set of theoretical predictions can be compared to extensive datasets to motivate improved modeling.},

Convection takes place over much of the star's radius. Conservation of angular momentum requires that the cores of these stars rotate faster than their envelopes; indirect evidence supports this. Information about the angular-momentum distribution is inaccessible to direct observations, but it can be extracted from the effect of rotation on oscillation modes that probe the stellar interior. Here we report an increasing rotation rate from the surface of the star to the stellar core in the interiors of red giants, obtained using the rotational frequency splitting of recently detected `mixed modes'. By comparison with theoretical stellar models, we conclude that the core must rotate at least ten times faster than the surface. This observational result confirms the theoretical prediction of a steep gradient in the rotation profile towards the deep stellar interior.},

One significant component of the expression, the dependence on rotation rate, persists from prior work; others do not. The expression has a bifurcation, as before, that corresponds to an observed bifurcation in the rotation periods of coeval open cluster stars. The dual dependencies of this loss rate on stellar mass are captured by two functions, f(B - V) and T(B - V), that can be determined from the rotation period observations. Equivalent masses and other [UBVRIJHK] colors are provided in Table 1. Dimensional considerations and a comparison with appropriate calculated quantities suggest interpretations for f and T, both of which appear to be related closely (but differently) to the calculated convective turnover timescale, τ c , in cool stars. This identification enables us to write down symmetrical expressions for the angular momentum loss rate and the deceleration of cool stars and also to revive the convective turnover timescale as a vital connection between stellar rotation and stellar activity physics.},

It is formulated only in terms of the Rossby number (Ro = P/τ), its inverse, and two dimensionless constants which we specify using solar and open-cluster data. The model has two limiting cases of stellar rotation, previously called C and I, that correspond to two observed sequences of fast and slowly rotating stars in young open clusters. The model describes the evolution of stars from C-type, with particular mass and age dependencies, to I-type, with different mass and age dependencies, through the rotational gap, g, separating them. The proposed model explains various aspects of stellar rotation, and provides an exact expression for the age of a rotating cool star in terms of P and τ, thereby generalizing gyrochronology. Using it, we calculate the time interval required for stars to reach the rotational gap—a monotonically increasing, mildly nonlinear function of τ. Beginning with the range of initial periods indicated by observations, we show that the (mass-dependent) dispersion in rotation period initially increases, and then decreases rapidly with the passage of time. The initial dispersion in period contributes up to 128 Myr to the gyro-age errors of solar-mass field stars. Finally, we transform to color-period space, calculate appropriate isochrones, and show that this model explains some detailed features in the observed color-period diagrams of open clusters, including the positions and shapes of the sequences, and the observed density of stars across these diagrams.},

This paper addresses the problem by presenting the first ever measurement of stellar differential rotation for a main-sequence solar-type star using starspots and faculae to provide complementary information. Our analysis uses modelling of light curves of multiple exoplanet transits for the young solar-type star Kepler-71, utilizing archival data from the Kepler mission. We estimate the physical characteristics of starspots and faculae on Kepler-71 from the characteristic amplitude variations they produce in the transit light curves and measure differential rotation from derived longitudes. Despite the higher contrast of faculae than those in the Sun, the bright features on Kepler-71 have similar properties such as increasing contrast towards the limb and larger sizes than sunspots. Adopting a solar-type differential rotation profile (faster rotation at the equator than the poles), the results from both starspot and facula analysis indicate a rotational shear less than about 0.005 rad d-1, or a relative differential rotation less than 2 per cent, and hence almost rigid rotation. This rotational shear contrasts with the strong rotational shear of zero-age main-sequence stars and the modest but significant shear of the modern-day Sun. Various explanations for the likely rigid rotation are considered.},

If the rotational modulation is due to starspots, persistent dark spots can be excluded from the lack of photometric variability in the Spitzer light curve. We construct a photometric model for rotational modulation due to photospheric bright spots on TRAPPIST-1 that is consistent with both the Kepler and Spitzer light curves. The maximum-likelihood model with three spots has typical spot sizes of Rspot/R⋆ ≈ 0.004 at temperature Tspot ≳ 5300 ± 200 K. We also find that large flares are observed more often when the brightest spot is facing the observer, suggesting a correlation between the position of the bright spots and flare events. In addition, these flares may occur preferentially when the spots are increasing in brightness, which suggests that the 3.3-day periodicity may not be a rotational signal, but rather a characteristic timescale of active regions.},

We present the first stellar activity analysis of star-spots and faculae for the hot Jupiter hosting M1V dwarf Kepler-45 from Kepler transit light curves. We find star-spot and facula temperatures contrasting a few hundred degrees with the quiet photosphere, hence similar to other early M dwarfs having a convective envelope surrounding a radiative core. Star-spots are prominent close to the centre of the stellar disc, with faculae prominent towards the limbs, similar to what is observed for the Sun. Star-spot and facula mean sizes are about 40 and 45 × 103 km, respectively, and thus faculae occupy a 10 per cent larger surface area than the star-spots. A short-term activity cycle of about 295 d is observed that is reminiscent of those seen for other cool dwarfs. Adopting a solar-type differential rotation profile (faster equatorial rotation than polar rotation), our star-spot and facula temporal mapping indicates a rotation period of 15.520 ± 0.025 d at the transit latitude of -33.2°. From the mean stellar rotation of 15.762 d, we estimate a rotational shear of 0.031 ± 0.004 rad d-1, or a relative differential rotation of 7.8 ± 0.9 per cent. Kepler-45's surface rotational shear is thus consistent with observations and theoretical modelling of other early M dwarfs that indicate a shear of less than 0.045 rad d-1 and no less than 0.03 rad d-1 for stars with similar stellar rotation periods.},

We find that, when taken separately, different databases are better fitted by different distributions (as has been reported previously in the literature). However, we find that all our databases can be reconciled by the simple application of a proportionality constant, and that, in reality, different databases are sampling different parts of a composite distribution. This composite distribution is made up by linear combination of Weibull and log-normal distributions—where a pure Weibull (log-normal) characterizes the distribution of structures with fluxes below (above) 1021Mx (1022Mx). Additionally, we demonstrate that the Weibull distribution shows the expected linear behavior of a power-law distribution (when extended to smaller fluxes), making our results compatible with the results of Parnell et al. We propose that this is evidence of two separate mechanisms giving rise to visible structures on the photosphere: one directly connected to the global component of the dynamo (and the generation of bipolar active regions), and the other with the small-scale component of the dynamo (and the fragmentation of magnetic structures due to their interaction with turbulent convection).},

	abstract = {We present the Transiting Exoplanet Surveying Satellite (TESS) light curve of the intermediate polar YY Draconis (YY Dra, also known as DO Dra). The power spectrum indicates that while there is stream-fed accretion for most of the observational period, there is a day-long, flat-bottomed low state at the beginning of 2020 during which the only periodic signal is ellipsoidal variation and there is no appreciable flickering. We interpret this low state to be a complete cessation of accretion, a phenomenon that has been observed only once before in an intermediate polar. Simultaneous ground-based observations of this faint state establish that when accretion is negligible, YY Dra fades to \$g=17.37{\textbackslash}pm0.12\$, which we infer to be the magnitude of the combined photospheric contributions of the white dwarf and its red dwarf companion. Using survey photometry, we identify additional low states in 2018-2019 during which YY Dra repeatedly fades to -- but never below -- this threshold. This implies relatively frequent cessations in accretion. Spectroscopic observations during future episodes of negligible accretion can be used to directly measure the field strength of the white dwarf by Zeeman splitting. Separately, we search newly available catalogs of variable stars in an attempt to resolve the long-standing dispute over the proper identifier of this system.},

	abstract = {WD 1145+017 is the first white dwarf known to be orbited by disintegrating exoasteroids. It is a DBZ-type white dwarf with strongly variable broad circumstellar lines and variable shallow UV transits. Various models of the dust clouds and gaseous rings have been proposed as an explanation for this behavior. Here we propose alternative models.The simple radiative transfer code Shellspec was modified for this purpose and used for testing the new dust cloud and gas disk models. We used modified TLUSTY and SYNSPEC codes to calculate atmosphere models assuming the LTE or NLTE, and to calculate the intrinsic spectrum of the star. We then used these atmosphere models to estimate the mass of the radiative and convective zones and NLTE spectrum synthesis to estimate their chemical composition. We offer an alternative explanation of some (not all) shallow UV transits. These may be naturally caused by the optical properties of the dust grains: opacities and mainly phase functions as a result of the forward scattering. The latter is much stronger in UV compared to the optical region, leaving more UV photons in the original direction during the transit. We also developed an alternative model of the gaseous disk, consisting of an inner, hotter, and almost circular disk and an outer, cooler, and eccentric disk. The structure precesses with a period of \$3.83 {\textbackslash}pm 0.12\$ yr. We demonstrate that it fits the observed circumstellar lines reasonably well. These alternative models solve a few drawbacks that might be associated with the previous models, but they also have their own disadvantages. We confirm that the chemical composition of the atmosphere is similar to that of CI chondrites but C, N, and S are significantly underabundant and much closer to the bulk Earth composition. This is a strong argument that the star has recently encountered and accreted material from a body of Earth-like composition.},

	abstract = {The rotation of a star and the revolutions of its planets are not necessarily aligned. This article reviews the measurement techniques, key findings, and theoretical interpretations related to the obliquities (spin-orbit angles) of planet-hosting stars. The best measurements are for stars with short-period giant planets, which have been found on prograde, polar, and retrograde orbits. It seems likely that dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering and secular perturbations are responsible for tilting the orbits of close-in giant planets, just as those processes are implicated in exciting orbital eccentricities. The observed dependence of the obliquity on orbital separation, planet mass, and stellar structure suggests that in some cases, tidal dissipation damps a star's obliquity within its main-sequence lifetime. The situation is not as clear for stars with smaller or wider-orbiting planets. Although the earliest measurements of such systems tended to find low obliquities, some glaring exceptions are now known in which the star's rotation is misaligned with respect to the coplanar orbits of multiple planets. In addition, statistical analyses based on projected rotation velocities and photometric variability have found a broad range of obliquities for F-type stars hosting compact multiple-planet systems. The results suggest it is unsafe to assume that stars and their protoplanetary disks are aligned. Primordial misalignments might be produced by neighboring stars or more complex events that occur during the epoch of planet formation.},

In this work, we demonstrate that such disks are capable of torquing the spin axis of their host star, representing a hitherto unexplored pathway by which stellar obliquities may be generated. The basis of this mechanism is a crossing of the stellar spin precession and inner disk regression frequencies, resulting in adiabatic excitation of the stellar obliquity. We derive analytical expressions for the characteristic frequencies of the inner disk and star as a function of the disk gap boundaries, and place an approximate limit on the disk architectures for which frequency crossing and resulting obliquity excitation are expected, thereby illustrating the efficacy of this model. Cumulatively, our results support the emerging concensus that significant spin-orbit misalignments are an expected outcome of planet formation.},

Using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, we reconstruct the distribution of brightness inhomogeneities and large-scale magnetic field at the surface of the K2 dwarf. Compared to previous tomographic reconstructions of the star carried out with the same code, we probe a new phase of the ETVs cycle, offering new constraints for future works exploring whether a magnetic mechanism operating in the K2 dwarf star is indeed able to induce the observed ETVs of V471 Tau.},

NGTS builds on the legacy of previous surveys, most notably WASP, and is designed to achieve higher photometric precision and hence find smaller planets than have previously been detected from the ground. It also operates in red light, maximizing sensitivity to late K and early M dwarf stars. The survey specifications call for photometric precision of 0.1 per cent in red light over an instantaneous field of view of 100 deg2, enabling the detection of Neptune-sized exoplanets around Sun-like stars and super-Earths around M dwarfs. The survey is carried out with a purpose-built facility at Cerro Paranal, Chile, which is the premier site of the European Southern Observatory (ESO). An array of twelve 20 cm f/2.8 telescopes fitted with back-illuminated deep-depletion CCD cameras is used to survey fields intensively at intermediate Galactic latitudes. The instrument is also ideally suited to ground-based photometric follow-up of exoplanet candidates from space telescopes such as TESS, Gaia and PLATO. We present observations that combine precise autoguiding and the superb observing conditions at Paranal to provide routine photometric precision of 0.1 per cent in 1 h for stars with I-band magnitudes brighter than 13.

	abstract = {Context. Flaring is an ubiquitous manifestation of magnetic activity in low mass stars including, of course, the Sun. Although flares, both from the Sun and from other stars, are most prominently observed in the soft X-ray band, most of the radiated energy is released at optical/UV wavelengths. In spite of decades of investigation, the physics of flares, even solar ones, is not fully understood. Even less is known about magnetic flaring in pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, at least in part because of the lack of suitable multi-wavelength data. This is unfortunate since the energetic radiation from stellar flares, which is routinely observed to be orders of magnitude greater than in solar flares, might have a significant impact on the evolution of circumstellar, planet-forming disks. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim at improving our understanding of flares from PMS stars. Our immediate objectives are constraining the relation between flare emission at X-ray, optical, and mid-infrared (mIR) bands, inferring properties of the optically emitting region, and looking for signatures of the interaction between flares and the circumstellar environment, i.e. disks and envelopes. This information might then serve as input for detailed models of the interaction between stellar atmospheres, circumstellar disks and proto-planets. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Observations of a large sample of PMS stars in the NGC 2264 star forming region were obtained in December 2011, simultaneously with three space-borne telescopes, Chandra (X-rays), CoRoT (optical), and Spitzer (mIR), as part of the "Coordinated Synoptic Investigation of NGC 2264" (CSI-NGC 2264). Shorter Chandra and CoRoT observations were also obtained in March 2008. We analyzed the lightcurves obtained during the Chandra observations (∼300 ks and ∼60 ks in 2011 and 2008, respectively), to detect X-ray flares with an optical and/or mIR counterpart. From the three datasets we then estimated basic flare properties, such as emitted energies and peak luminosities. These were then compared to constrain the spectral energy distribution of the flaring emission and the physical conditions of the emitting regions. The properties of flares from stars with and without circumstellar disks were also compared to establish any difference that might be attributed to the presence of disks. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Seventy-eight X-ray flares (from 65 stars) with an optical and/or mIR counterpart were detected. The optical emission of flares (both emitted energy and peak flux) is found to correlate well with, and to be significantly larger than, the X-ray emission. The slopes of the correlations suggest that the difference becomes smaller for the most powerful flares. The mIR flare emission seems to be strongly affected by the presence of a circumstellar disk: flares from stars with disks have a stronger mIR emission with respect to stars without disks. This might be attributed to either a cooler temperature of the region emitting both the optical and mIR flux or, perhaps more likely, to the reprocessing of the optical (and X-ray) flare emission by the inner circumstellar disk, providing evidence for flare-induced disk heating. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Tables of the data used to build the figures of Appendix B are only available in electronic form via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/620/A55"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/620/A55{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

The data analysis procedure has discarded a non-negligible fraction of light curves due to instrumental artefacts; however, it has allowed us to identify pulsators and binaries among a large number of field stars. We measure a wide range of periods, from 0.25 to 100 d, most of which are rotation periods. The final catalogue includes 1978 periods, with 1727 of them identified as rotational periods, 169 as pulsations and 82 as orbital periods of binary systems. Our sample suffers from selection biases not easily corrected for; thus, we do not use the distribution of rotation periods to derive the age distribution of the main-sequence population. Nevertheless, using rotation as a proxy for age, we can identify a sample of young stars (≤600 Myr) that will constitute a valuable sample, supported by further spectroscopic observations, to study the recent star formation history in the solar neighbourhood.

	abstract = {Measuring the evolution of X-ray emission from pre-main sequence (PMS) stars gives insight into two issues: the response of magnetic dynamo processes to changes in interior structure and the effects of high-energy radiation on protoplanetary disks and primordial planetary atmospheres. We present a sample of 6,003 stars with ages [7-25] Myr in ten nearby open clusters from Chandra X-ray and Gaia-EDR3 surveys. Combined with previous results in large samples of younger ({\textless}5 Myr) stars in MYStIX and SFiNCs star forming regions, mass-stratified activity-age relations are derived for early phases of stellar evolution. X-ray luminosity (Lx) is constant during the first few Myr, possibly due to the presence of extended X-ray coronas insensitive to temporal changes in stellar size. Lx then decays during the [7-25] Myr period, more rapidly as stellar mass increases. This decay is interpreted as decreasing efficiency of the alpha{\textasciicircum}2 dynamo as radiative cores grow and a solar-type alpha-Omega dynamo emerges. For more massive [2-7] Msun fully radiative stars, the X-ray emission plummets indicating lack of an effective magnetic dynamos. The findings provide improved measurements of high energy radiation effects on circumstellar material, first the protoplanetary disk and then the atmospheres of young planets. The observed X-ray luminosities can be so high that an inner Earth-mass rocky, unmagnetized planet around a solar-mass PMS star might lose its primary and secondary atmospheres within a few-several million years. PMS X-ray emission may thus have a significant impact on evolution of early planetary atmospheres and the conditions promoting the rise of habitability.},

The star was a target of the Kepler/K2 mission and was observed by the EDEN project, a global network of 1-2 m class telescopes for detection and characterization of rocky exoplanets in the habitable zones of late-M dwarfs within 50 light year from the solar system. In the combination of the archived K2 data and our EDEN observations, a total of 872 flares have been detected, 861 with the K2 (860 in the short-cadence and 18 in the long-cadence data, with 17 long-cadence events having short-cadence counterparts) and 11 with EDEN. Wolf 359 has relatively strong flare activity even among flaring M dwarfs, in terms of the flare activity indicator (FA) defined as the integrated flare energy relative to the total stellar bolometric energy, where FA = ∑Ef/∫Lbol dt ∼ 8.93 × 10-5 for the long-cadence flares, whereas for K2 short cadence and EDEN flares, the FA values are somewhat larger, FA ≍ 6.67 × 10-4 and FA ≍ 5.25 × 10-4, respectively. Such a level of activity, in accordance with the rotation period (Prot), suggests the star to be in the saturation phase. The size of the starspots is estimated to be at least 1.87\% ± 0.59\% of the projected disk area of Wolf 359. We find no correlation of FA with the stellar rotational phase. Our analysis indicates a flare frequency distribution in a power-law form of \$\{dN\}/\{dE\}{\textbackslash}propto \{E\}{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}alpha \}\$ with α = 2.13 ± 0.14, equivalent to an occurrence rate of flares Ef ≥ 1031 erg about once per day and of superflares with Ef ≥ 1033 erg approximately 10 times per year.

We present observations of three nearby M dwarfs referred to as EIC-1, EIC-2, and EIC-3, and use them to search for transits and set limits on the presence of planets. On most nights our observations are sensitive to Earth-sized transiting planets, and photometric precision is similar to or better than TESS for faint late-M dwarfs of the same magnitude (I ≍ 15 mag). We present our photometry and transit search pipeline, which utilizes simple median detrending in combination with transit least-squares-based transit detection. For these targets, and transiting planets between one and two Earth radii, we achieve an average transit detection probability of ∼60\% between periods of 0.5 and 2 days, ∼30\% between 2 and 5 days, and ∼10\% between 5 and 10 days.

	abstract = {We use chemistry ([alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H]), main sequence turnoff ages, and kinematics determined from H3 Survey spectroscopy and Gaia astrometry to identify the birth of the Galactic disk. We separate in-situ and accreted stars on the basis of angular momenta and eccentricities. The sequence of high-alpha in-situ stars persists down to at least [Fe/H]=-2.5 and shows unexpected non-monotonic behavior: with increasing metallicity the population first declines in [alpha/Fe], then increases over the range -1.3{\textless}[Fe/H]{\textless}-0.7, and then declines again at higher metallicities. The number of stars in the in-situ population rapidly increases above [Fe/H]=-1. The average kinematics of these stars are hot and independent of metallicity at [Fe/H]{\textless}-1 and then become increasingly cold and disk-like at higher metallicities. The ages of the in-situ, high-alpha stars are uniformly very old (13 Gyr) at [Fe/H]{\textless}-1.3, and span a wider range (8-12 Gyr) at higher metallicities. Interpreting the chemistry with a simple chemical evolution model suggests that the non-monotonic behavior is due to a significant increase in star formation efficiency, which began 13 Gyr ago. These results support a picture in which the first 1 Gyr of the Galaxy was characterized by a "simmering phase" in which the star formation efficiency was low and the kinematics had substantial disorder with some net rotation. The disk then underwent a dramatic transformation to a "boiling phase", in which the star formation efficiency increased substantially, the kinematics became disk-like, and the number of stars formed increased tenfold. We interpret this transformation as the birth of the Galactic disk at z{\textasciitilde}4. The physical origin of this transformation is unclear and does not seem to be reproduced in current galaxy formation models.},

	abstract = {In the canonical theory of stellar magnetic dynamo, the tachocline in partially convective stars serves to arrange small-scale fields, generated by stochastic movement of plasma into a coherent large-scale field. Mid-to-late M-dwarfs, which are fully convective, show more magnetic activity than classical magnetic dymano theory predicts. However, mid-to-late M-dwarfs show tight correlations between rotation and magnetic activity, consistent with elements of classical dynamo theory. We use data from Magellan Inamori Kyocera Echelle (MIKE) Spectrograph to detail the relation between Ca II H{\textbackslash}\&K flux and rotation period for these low-mass stars. We measure \$R'\_\{HK\}\$ values for 53 spectroscopically identified M-dwarfs selected from the MEarth survey; these stars span spectral classes from M5.0 to M3.5 and have rotation periods ranging from hours to months. We present the rotation--activity relationship as traced through these data. We find power law and saturated regimes consistent to within one sigma of previously published results and observe a mass dependence in \$R'\_\{HK\}\$.},

Yet observational interpretations of photospheric currents in pre-eruptive sigmoids, shear in post-flare loops, and relative positioning and shapes of flare ribbons, all together require three-dimensional extensions to the model. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We focus on the strong-to-weak shear transition in post-flare loops, and on the time-evolution of the geometry of photospheric electric currents, which occur during the development of eruptive flares. The objective is to understand the three-dimensional physical processes, which cause them, and to know how much the post-flare and the pre-eruptive distributions of shear depend on each other. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The strong-to-weak shear transition in post-flare loops is identified and quantified in a flare observed by STEREO, as well as in a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of CME initiation performed with the OHM code. In both approaches, the magnetic shear is evaluated with field line footpoints. In the simulation, the shear is also estimated from ratios between magnetic field components. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The modeled strong-to-weak shear transition in post-flare loops comes from two effects. Firstly, a reconnection-driven transfer of the differential magnetic shear, from the pre- to the post-eruptive configuration. Secondly, a vertical straightening of the inner legs of the CME, which induces an outer shear weakening. The model also predicts the occurrence of narrow electric current layers inside J-shaped flare ribbons, which are dominated by direct currents. Finally, the simulation naturally accounts for energetics and time-scales for weak and strong flares, when typical scalings for young and decaying solar active regions are applied. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The results provide three-dimensional extensions to the standard flare model. These extensions involve MHD processes that should be tested with observations.},

The magnetic field and current density have toroidal and poloidal components. The footpoints of the loop are assumed to be stationary in the dense photosphere, and current conservation is assumed to be established in or below the photosphere. Starting with non-force-free model loops in MHD equilibrium, the expansion motion of the loops is investigated. Some equilibrium loops are found to be unstable to major radial expansion. The condition for instability is given in terms of a parameter, which is a measure of the ratio of fluxes above and below the photosphere associated with the current loop. The motion of an unstable loop is due to the toroidicity of the current loop and is determined by the Lorentz force, pressure gradient, and drag force due to the ambient gas. It is found that model loops can exhibit a wide range of expansion motion with a correspondingly wide range of magnetic-energy dissipation due to drag heating.},

	abstract = {The equilibrium shape of a slender flux tube in the stratified solar atmosphere is studied. The path is determined by a balance between the downwards magnetic tension, which depends on the curvature of the loop, and the upwards buoyancy force. Previous results for untwisted slender tubes are extended to include twisted tubes embedded in an external magnetic field. The path of an untwisted tube in an atmosphere with an ambient magnetic field is calculated. For a given footpoint separation, the height of the tube is lowered by increasing the strength of the external magnetic field. If the footpoints are slowly moved apart, the tube rises, until a threshold separation is reached beyond which there is no possible equilibrium height. This threshold width does not depend on the strength of the external field. The effects of twisting up a curved loop are studied, using an extension of results obtained for slender curved tubes with a straight axis. It is shown that for a twisted tube of given width, there can be two possible values of the equilibrium height. If, however, the tube is twisted more than a certain amount or if the footpoints are too widely separated there is no equilibrium. The critical footpoint separation for non-equilibrium is smaller for a twisted tube that an untwisted one. Twisting a tube or moving its feet apart is thus likely to result in non-equilibrium, causing the tube to rise indefinitely under the influence of the unbalanced buoyant force. It is suggested that this phenomenon could be important in the preflare stage of a large two-ribbon solar flare, by causing the initial slow rise of an active region filament. As well as being involved in the onset of an erupting prominence, this non-equilibrium may also be relevant to the formation of coronal loop transients.},

This Neptune-size object, discovered by the NASA K2 mission, is an interloper in the ‘desert’ of planets with similar radii on short-period orbits. Our observations can be used to understand its origin and evolution by constraining the orbital eccentricity by transit fitting, measuring the spin-orbit obliquity by the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, and detecting any extended, escaping the hydrogen–helium envelope with the 10 830 -Å line of neutral helium in the 2s3S triplet state. Transit photometry with 1-min cadence was obtained by the K2 satellite during Campaign 18 and transit spectra were obtained with the IRD spectrograph on the Subaru telescope. While the elevated activity of K2-100 prevented us from detecting the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, the new photometry combined with revised stellar parameters allowed us to constrain the eccentricity to e \&lt; 0.15/0.28 with 90/99 per cent confidence. We modelled atmospheric escape as an isothermal, spherically symmetric Parker wind, with photochemistry driven by ultraviolet radiation, which we estimate by combining the observed spectrum of the active Sun with calibrations from observations of K2-100 and similar young stars in the nearby Hyades cluster. Our non-detection (\&lt;5.7 m Å) of a transit-associated He i line limits mass-loss of a solar-composition atmosphere through a T ≤ 10000 K wind to \&lt;0.3 M⊕ Gyr−1.

	abstract = {The Kepler spacecraft provided the first long-baseline, high-precision photometry for large numbers of stars. This enabled the discovery of thousands of new exoplanets, and the characterization of myriad astrophysical phenomena. However, one of the challenges with interpreting Kepler data has been that no instrument has provided a comparison dataset. Therefore, the replication of Kepler time-series data has remained elusive. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) launched in April 2018 and began science operations in July 2018. During the TESS primary mission, it will survey 85\% of the sky. NASA's first two observatories dedicated to discovering exoplanets, Kepler and TESS, were simultaneously operating during 2018. While the Kepler's K2 mission surveyed the ecliptic plane, TESS targets fields outside the ecliptic. However, during September 2018, a small region of the sky was observed simultaneously by both TESS and Kepler as part of TESS's Sector 2 (Aug 22 - Sep 20, 2018) and K2 Campaign 19 (Sep 7 - Sep 26, 2018). The overlap region was 0.5 sq. deg. We identified 171 K2 targets that fell inside TESS Sector 2 field of view, all of which are observed at 30-minute cadence by both missions. The targets range in brightness in the TESS bandpass (Tmag) from 6.7-18.4, with 93 targets brighter than Tmag=15, and 17 brighter than Tmag=12. This dataset provides the first simultaneous, long-duration, high-precision observations of the same targets from different space-based observatories and presents an excellent opportunity to explore instrumental systematics present in the two telescopes.},

Close-in planets generally orbit in the sub-alfvénic region of the stellar wind, which leads to efficient transfers of energy and angular momentum between the star and the planet. We model the magnetic interactions occurring in close-in star-planet systems with three-dimensional, global, compressible magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations of a planet orbiting in a self-consistent stellar wind. We focus on the cases of magnetized planets and explore three representative magnetic configurations. The Poynting flux originating from the magnetic interactions is an energy source for enhanced emissions in star-planet systems. Our results suggest a simple geometrical explanation for ubiquitous on/off enhanced emissions associated with close-in planets, and confirm that the Poynting fluxes can reach powers of the order of 1019 W. Close-in planets are also shown to migrate due to magnetic torques for sufficiently strong stellar wind magnetic fields. The topology of the interaction significantly modifies the shape of the magnetic obstacle that leads to magnetic torques. As a consequence, the torques can vary by at least an order of magnitude as the magnetic topology of the interaction varies.},

Thermal escape models suggest that exoplanetary atmospheres around active K-M stars should undergo massive hydrogen escape, while heavier species including oxygen will accumulate forming an oxidizing atmosphere. Here, we show that non-thermal oxygen ion escape could be as important as thermal, hydrodynamic H escape in removing the constituents of water from exoplanetary atmospheres under supersolar XUV irradiation. Our models suggest that the atmospheres of a significant fraction of Earth-like exoplanets around M dwarfs and active K stars exposed to high XUV fluxes will incur a significant atmospheric loss rate of oxygen and nitrogen, which will make them uninhabitable within a few tens to hundreds of Myr, given a low replenishment rate from volcanism or cometary bombardment.

This review focuses on recent observations in EUV, soft and hard X-rays, white light, and radio waves. Space missions such as RHESSI, Yohkoh, TRACE, SOHO, and more recently Hinode and SDO have enlarged widely the observational base. They have revealed a number of surprises: Coronal sources appear before the hard X-ray emission in chromospheric footpoints, major flare acceleration sites appear to be independent of coronal mass ejections, electrons, and ions may be accelerated at different sites, there are at least 3 different magnetic topologies, and basic characteristics vary from small to large flares. Recent progress also includes improved insights into the flare energy partition, on the location(s) of energy release, tests of energy release scenarios and particle acceleration. The interplay of observations with theory is important to deduce the geometry and to disentangle the various processes involved. There is increasing evidence supporting magnetic reconnection as the basic cause. While this process has become generally accepted as the trigger, it is still controversial how it converts a considerable fraction of the energy into non-thermal particles. Flare-like processes may be responsible for large-scale restructuring of the magnetic field in the corona as well as for its heating. Large flares influence interplanetary space and substantially affect the Earth’s ionosphere. Flare scenarios have slowly converged over the past decades, but every new observation still reveals major unexpected results, demonstrating that solar flares, after 150 years since their discovery, remain a complex problem of astrophysics including major unsolved questions.},

The magnetic field of the star is known to play a key role, but, despite significant advancements in solar telescopes, computing power and much greater understanding of theoretical mechanisms, the question of which mechanism or mechanisms are the dominant supplier of energy to the chromosphere and corona is still open.

Stellar X-ray emission also provides important diagnostics to study the structure and evolution of stellar magnetic fields from the first days of a protostellar life to the latest stages of stellar evolution among giants and supergiants. The discipline of stellar coronal X-ray astronomy has now reached a level of sophistication that makes tests of advanced theories in stellar physics possible. This development is based on the rapidly advancing instrumental possibilities that today allow us to obtain images with sub-arcsecond resolution and spectra with resolving powers exceeding 1000. High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy has, in fact, opened new windows into astrophysical sources, and has played a fundamental role in coronal research.},

Our observational picture of cool-star magnetic fields has improved tremendously over the last years. Sophisticated methods were developed to search for the subtle effects of magnetism, which are difficult to detect particularly in cool stars. With an emphasis on the assumptions and capabilities of modern methods used to measure magnetism in cool stars, I review the different techniques available for magnetic field measurements.

Our models consider 0.3 solar-mass stars using the Anelastic Spherical Harmonic code, with the spherical computational domain extending from 0.08 to 0.96 times the overall stellar radius. Like previous authors, we find that fully convective stars can generate kG-strength magnetic fields (in rough equipartition with the convective flows) without the aid of a tachocline of shear. Although our model stars are everywhere unstably stratified, the amplitudes and typical pattern sizes of the convective flows vary strongly with radius, with the outer regions of the stars hosting vigorous convection and field amplification while the deep interiors are more quiescent. Modest differential rotation is established in hydrodynamic calculations, but—unlike in some prior work—strongly quenched in MHD simulations because of the Maxwell stresses exerted by the dynamo-generated magnetic fields. Despite the lack of strong differential rotation, the magnetic fields realized in the simulations possess significant mean (axisymmetric) components, which we attribute partly to the strong influence of rotation on the slowly overturning flows.},

This first paper presents rotation periods for 290 low-mass stars in NGC 6530, the young cluster illuminating the nebula, and for which we assemble a catalog of infrared and spectroscopic disk indicators, estimated masses and ages, and X-ray luminosities. The distribution of rotation periods we measure is broadly uniform for 0.5 days {\textless} P {\textless} 10 days; the short-period cutoff corresponds to breakup. We observe no obvious bimodality in the period distribution, but we do find that stars with disk signatures rotate more slowly on average. The stars' X-ray luminosities are roughly flat with rotation period, at the saturation level (log LX /L bol ≈ -3.3). However, we find a significant positive correlation between LX /L bol and corotation radius, suggesting that the observed X-ray luminosities are regulated by centrifugal stripping of the stellar coronae. The period-mass relationship in NGC 6530 is broadly similar to that of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), but the slope of the relationship among the slowest rotators differs from that in the ONC and other young clusters. We show that the slope of the period-mass relationship for the slowest rotators can be used as a proxy for the age of a young cluster, and we argue that NGC 6530 may be slightly younger than the ONC, making it a particularly important touchstone for models of angular momentum evolution in young, low-mass stars.},

Similarity solutions are determined for the collapse of singular isothermal spheres, minus solutions without critical points are obtained by imposing the condition that the fluid velocities are negligible at the 'initial instant', and an expansion-wave collapse solution is evaluated. The results are illustrated with a numerical example roughly corresponding to conditions appropriate for Bok globules or the central regions of a nonmagnetic molecular cloud.

	abstract = {A new analysis of the published long-term photometric observations has revealed permanent active-longitude structures in four RS CVn stars: EI Eri, II Peg, sigma Gem, and HR 7275. Two active longitudes separated by half of the period are found to dominate on the surface during all available seasons. The positions of the longitudes on three stars (EI Eri, II Peg, HR 7275) are migrating in the orbital reference frame, and there is no preferred orientation with respect to the line of centres in the binaries. The rate of migration is approximately constant. In case of sigma Gem the active longitude migration is synchronized with the orbital motion in the direction of the line of centres in the binary. The active region lifetimes can be longer than the time span of the observations (\&gt;=15 yr). The periods of the active longitude rotation are determined: for EI Eri 1fd 9510, for II Peg 6fd 7066, for sigma Gem 19fd 604, for HR 7275 28fd 263. Long-term activity cycles of the stars are discovered from the analysis of the relative contribution of the two longitudes to the photometric variability. One longitude is found to be usually more active than the other at a given moment, and the change of the activity level between the longitudes is cyclic with periods of years. The switch of the activity takes a much shorter time, about a few months, similar to the ``flip-flop'' phenomenon found for FK Com stars. Moments of switching are regarded as new tracers of the activity, and total cycles, which return activity to the same longitude, are found to be for EI Eri 9.0 yr, for II Peg 9.3 yr, for sigma Gem 14.9 yr, for HR 7275 17.5 yr.},

In the Carrington reference frame, the active longitudes continuously migrate in phase with respect to the Carrington meridian with a variable rate. They remain however a quasi-rigid structure. We find that the migration of the active longitudes is determined by changes of the mean latitude of sunspots and the differential rotation. The differential rotation rate calculated from the migration is in agreement with SOHO/MDI measurements. The two active longitude periodically alternate being the dominant region, similar to the ``flip-flop'' phenomenon known in starspot activity. The period of the oscillations is 3.8 and 3.65 years in the north and south, respectively. The difference between the periods is significant and can be related to the known north-south asymmetry in the solar magnetic activity. Our results provide new observational constraints for current solar dynamo models and strengthen the solar paradigm for magnetic activity on cool stars.},

The mechanism by which spin-up is regulated as young stars contract has been one of the longest standing problems in star formation. Attempts to observationally confirm the prevailing theory that magnetic interaction between the star and its circumstellar disk regulates these rotation periods have produced mixed results. In this paper, we use the unprecedented disk identification capability of the Spitzer Space Telescope to test the star-disk interaction paradigm in two young clusters, NGC 2264 and the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We show that once mass effects and sensitivity biases are removed, a clear increase in the disk fraction with period can be observed in both clusters across the entire period range populated by cluster members. We also show that the long-period peak (P{\textasciitilde}8 days) of the bimodal distribution observed for high-mass stars in the ONC is dominated by a population of stars possessing a disk, while the short-period peak (P{\textasciitilde}2 days) is dominated by a population of stars without a disk. Our results represent the strongest evidence to date that star-disk interaction regulates the angular momentum of these young stars. This study will make possible quantitative comparisons between the observed period distributions of stars with and without a disk and numerical models of the angular momentum evolution of young stars.},

	abstract = {To investigate what happens to angular momentum during the earliest observable phases of stellar evolution, we searched the literature for periods (P), projected rotational velocities (vsini), and supporting data on K5-M2 stars (corresponding to masses 0.25-1 Msolar) from the Orion Nebula Cluster and environs, ρ Ophiuchi, TW Hydra, Taurus-Auriga, NGC 2264, Chamaeleon, Lupus, and η Chamaeleonis. We combine these measures of rotation with the stellar R (as determined from Lbol and Teff) to compare the data with two extreme cases: conservation of stellar angular velocity and conservation of stellar angular momentum. Analysis of the P data set suggests that the frequency distribution of periods among the youngest and oldest stars in the sample is indistinguishable, while the vsini data set reveals a decrease in mean vsini as a function of age. Both results suggest that a significant fraction of all pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars must evolve at nearly constant angular velocity during the first {\textasciitilde}3-5 Myr after they begin their evolution down the convective tracks. Hence, the angular momenta of a significant fraction of pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars must be tightly regulated during the first few million years after they first become observable. This result seems surprising at first glance, because observations of young main-sequence stars reveal a population (30\%-40\%) of rapidly rotating stars that must begin to spin up at ages t{\textless}{\textless}5 Myr. To determine whether these apparently contradictory results are reconcilable, we use simple models along with our data set to place limits on (1) the fraction of PMS stars that must be regulated, and (2) the complementary fraction that could spin up as a function of time but escape statistical detection given the broad distribution of stellar rotation rates. These models include (1) instantaneous release at the stellar birthline of a given fraction of stars, with the remaining fraction regulated for 10 Myr; (2) all stars regulated initially, with the released fraction varying linearly with time, and timescales for release of half the stars varying from 0.5 to 5 Myr (i.e., all released by 1 to 10 Myr); and (3) a hybrid model that invokes assumptions (1) and (2). In all cases, we find that a modest population (30\%-40\%) of PMS stars could be released within the first 1 Myr and still produce period distributions statistically consistent with the observed data. This population is large enough to account for the rapid rotators observed among young main-sequence stars of comparable mass. The limits placed by our models on the fraction of regulated and released stars as a function of time are also consistent with the lifetime of accretion disks as inferred from near-IR excesses, and hence with the hypothesis that disk locking accounts for rotation regulation during early PMS phases.},

In the Sun, both the fields themselves and their influence on other phenomena can be uncovered in exquisite detail, but these observations sample only a moment in a single star’s life. By turning to observations of other stars, and to theory and simulation, we may infer other aspects of the magnetism—e.g., its dependence on stellar age, mass, or rotation rate—that would be invisible from close study of the Sun alone. Here, we review observations and theory of magnetism in the Sun and other stars, with a partial focus on the “Solar-stellar connection”: i.e., ways in which studies of other stars have influenced our understanding of the Sun and vice versa. We briefly review techniques by which magnetic fields can be measured (or their presence otherwise inferred) in stars, and then highlight some key observational findings uncovered by such measurements, focusing (in many cases) on those that offer particularly direct constraints on theories of how the fields are built and maintained. We turn then to a discussion of how the fields arise in different objects: first, we summarize some essential elements of convection and dynamo theory, including a very brief discussion of mean-field theory and related concepts. Next we turn to simulations of convection and magnetism in stellar interiors, highlighting both some peculiarities of field generation in different types of stars and some unifying physical processes that likely influence dynamo action in general. We conclude with a brief summary of what we have learned, and a sampling of issues that remain uncertain or unsolved.},

Further, the rotational decay curve is found to satisfy the same law. It is further suggested that lithium depletion follows the same law but only as far as the Hyades age, after which the depletion proceeds exponentially. Since Ca+ emission is linearly proportional to magnetic field strength at the surface, one can predict that the surface fields are proportional to angular velocity and decay as the inverse square root. The above results are predicated Qi' the standard Hyades age (0.4 billion years).},

	abstract = {Broad and shallow absorption lines in stellar spectra are shown to be due to axial rotation. The evidence is based upon the following facts: (a) the broadening depends upon wave-length, as required by the Doppler principle; (b) in spectroscop'ic binaries there is a distinct correlation between line width on one side and period and amplitude on the other; and (c) as was shown by Elvey, the contours of "dish-shaped" lines agree well with the theoretical shapes of lines of rapidly rotating stars. A survey of the spectra of stars of various types shows that rapid rotation is peculiar to the earliest spectral classes. The B- and A-stars display the greatest tendency toward rapid rotation. In the F's the proportion of rapidly rotating stars is smaller, and in classes G, K, and M no cases of rapid rotation have been observed in single stars. The effect of rotation upon the contours of components of spectroscopic binaries is discussed. In a Virginis the stronger component is found to rotate with an equatorial velocity of 200 km/sec., while for the fainter component the rotational velocity is not more than about 50 km/sec. This indicates a marked difference in the size of the com- ponents. The ratio of the radii is roughly 4 to i. The contours of lines in i{\textasciitilde} Ursae Majoris suggest an equatorial velocity of about 200 km/sec. This single star is thus similar to the stronger component of a Virginis. Both stars are found to be stable, but the characteristic quantity w2/27r{\textasciitilde}yp is not far from the critical value where the Maclaurin ellipsoids of rotation lose stability. It is suggested that there is a transition between close s{\textasciitilde}ectroscopic binaries and rapidly rotating single -stars in the earliest spectral classes. Observations do not establish the direction in which this transition proceeds},

These line widths have been expressed in terms of v sin i, the projected equatorial velocity required of a rotating, spherical, limb-darkened star in order to reproduce the observed broadening. It seems reasonable that axial rotation is the principal macroscopic broadening agent in those stars less luminous than supergiants, but this is not necessarily the case for the high-luminosity stars. The main conclusions of the pa er are as follows: (1) The mean rotational velocity diminishes through class F, but V sin i values of 20 km sec or greater can be found in types as late as F8 (in luminosity classes II, IV-V, and V) or Go (in classes III and IV). With the exception of two binaries, no stars of type later than G5 have been found with rotationally broadened lines, and the widening in a few single stars of types G2-G5 is marginal. (2) For a given spectral type between F0 and GO, the stars of luminosity classes III and IV have much higher mean rotational velocities than do those of class V. (3) There is no significant difference in the rotational velocities of the weak- and strong-line groups of F- and G-type stars. (4) The luminosity class Ia supergiants have considerably wider lines than do those of class Ib.},

For this purpose we have carried out careful corrections of the different sources of errors derived from the observing technique. By comparing with other results of the same century, a significant difference is only detected by comparing with data corresponding to the deep Maunder Minimum (Paris Observatory drawings). The characteristics of the solar differential rotation, and extrapolating the behavior of solar activity, did not differ before or after the Maunder Minimum.

	abstract = {For flares to be generated, stars have to have a sufficiently deep outer convection zone (F5 and later), strong large-scale magnetic fields (Ap/Bp-type stars) or strong, radiatively driven winds (B5 and earlier). Normal A-type stars possess none of these and therefore should not flare. Nevertheless, flares have previously been detected in the Kepler light curves of 33 A-type stars and interpreted to be intrinsic to the stars. Here, we present new and detailed analyses of these 33 stars, imposing very strict criteria for the flare detection. We confirm the presence of flare-like features in 27 of the 33 A-type stars. A study of the pixel data and the surrounding field of view reveals that 14 of these 27 flaring objects have overlapping neighbouring stars and five stars show clear contamination in the pixel data. We have obtained high-resolution spectra for 2/3 of the entire sample and confirm that our targets are indeed A-type stars. Detailed analyses revealed that 11 out of 19 stars with multiple epochs of observations are spectroscopic binaries. Furthermore, and contrary to previous studies, we find that the flares can originate from a cooler, unresolved companion. We note the presence of Hα emission in eight stars. Whether this emission is circumstellar or magnetic in origin is unknown. In summary, we find possible alternative explanations for the observed flares for at least 19 of the 33 A-type stars, but find no truly convincing target to support the hypothesis of flaring A-type stars.},

	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to give a reliable estimate of the number of flaring giant stars in the Kepler field. By analyzing the flaring activity of these stars, we explored their flare statistics and the released flare energies. The role of oscillation in suppressing magnetic activity was also investigated. We searched for flaring specialities that may be associated with the giant nature across a sample of flaring giant stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We searched for flares using the ≈4 yr long Kepler data on a sample of 706 stars compiled from two lists of flaring giants (log g ≤ 3.5) found in the literature. To lessen the probability of false positives two different pipelines are used independently for flare detection. Tests are carried out to correct the detection bias at low flare energies for a subsample of 19 further studied, frequently flaring stars. For these 19 stars flare energy distributions and flare frequency diagrams (FFDs) are constructed. For comparison purposes KIC 2852961 is re-analyzed with our present approach. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: From the 706 Kepler flaring giant candidates, we ruled out those where oscillations or pulsations were misclassified and those that turned out to be dwarf stars. Finally, we confirm only 61 stars as flaring giants. Among these 61 flaring giants, we found only six that also show oscillations; we suggest that a large fraction of the 61 flaring giants are members of spectroscopic binaries, which has already been proven for 11 of them. The number of detected flares on giant stars correlate only weakly with the rotational periods. The FFDs for the 19 most flaring stars were fit by power-law functions. Regarding log-log representation, the slopes of the individual fits lead to an average α = 2.01 ± 0.16 power-law index, but the ranges of flare energies scatter within almost two orders, showing the inherent heterogeneity of the sample of flaring giants. Broken power-law fits are applied for two giant stars that have similar flare energy ranges; however, the energy at the breakpoints of the power laws are different, unveiling possible differences in the magnetic field strengths and atmospheric structures of these stars. The average power-law index of α ≈ 2 is the same for the flaring giants, the (super)flaring G-dwarfs, and dwarf stars between spectral types M6 and L0. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The 61 confirmed flaring giant stars make up only ≈0.3\% of the entire giant star population in the Kepler database, which is in contrast with previous estimates of about an order higher percentage. We found that most of the false positives are in fact oscillating red giants. No strong correlation was found between the stellar properties and the flaring characteristics. The majority of the flaring specialities are hardly related to the giant nature, if at all. This, together with the finding that the observed flare durations correlate with flare energies, regardless of the flare energy level and stellar luminosity class, suggests common background physics in flaring stars, or in other words, a general scaling effect behind the flares on different stars.},

	abstract = {Rates of flaring in individual active regions on the Sun during the period 1981–1999 are examined using United States Air Force/Mount Wilson (USAF/MWL) active-region observations together with the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) soft X-ray flare catalog. Of the flares in the catalog above C1 class, 61.5\% are identified with an active region. Evidence is presented for obscuration, i.e. that the increase in soft X-ray flux during a large flare decreases the likelihood of detection of soft X-ray events immediately following the large flare. This effect means that many events are missing from the GOES catalog. It is estimated that in the absence of obscuration the number of flares above C1 class would be higher by (75±23) \%. A second observational selection effect – an increased tendency for larger flares to be identified with an active region – is also identified. The distributions of numbers of flares produced by individual active regions and of mean flaring rate among active regions are shown to be approximately exponential, although there are excess numbers of active regions with low flare numbers and low flaring rates. A Bayesian procedure is used to analyze the time history of the flaring rate in the individual active regions. A substantial number of active regions appear to exhibit variation in flaring rate during their transit of the solar disk. Examples are shown of regions with and without rate variation, illustrating the different distributions of times between events (waiting-time distributions) that are observed. A piecewise constant Poisson process is found to provide a good model for the observed waiting-time distributions. Finally, applications of analysis of the rate of flaring to understanding the flare mechanism and to flare prediction are discussed.},

When near-surface activity is distributed in a non-homogeneous manner, oscillation modes of different angular degree and azimuthal order will have their frequencies shifted by different amounts. We use this simple concept, coupled to a model for the spatial distribution of the near-surface activity, to develop two methods that use the frequency shifts to infer minimum and maximum latitudes for the active bands. Our methods respond to the range in latitude over which there is significant magnetic flux present, over and above weak basal ephemeral flux levels. We verify that we are able to draw accurate inferences in the solar case, using Sun-as-a-star helioseismic data and artificial data. We then apply our methods to Kepler data on the solar analogue HD 173701, and find that its active bands straddle a much wider range in latitude than do the bands on the Sun.},

We have investigated the flaring time interval distribution (waiting-time distribution) and the spatial correlation of successive flare pairs. The observed waiting-time distribution for the whole data is found to be well represented by a nonstationary Poisson probability function with time-varying mean flaring rates. The period most suitable for a constant mean flaring rate is determined to be 2–3 days by a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We have also found that the waiting-time distribution for flares in individual active regions follows a stationary Poisson probability function m exp(−mt) with a corresponding mean flaring rate. Therefore the flaring probability within a given time is given by 1 - exp(-mt), when the mean flaring rate m is properly estimated. It is also found that there are no systematic relationships between peak fluxes of flares and their waiting-time distributions. The above findings support the idea that the solar corona is in a self-organized critical state. A comparison of the angular distances of successively observed flare pairs with those of hypothetical flare pairs generated by random distribution shows a positive angular correlation within ∼ 10° (∼ 180 arc sec in the observing field) of angular separation, which suggests that homologous flares occurring in the same active region should outnumber sympathetic flares.},

It is assumed that flares occur at well-defined, isolated sites within an active region, determined by the null points and separators of the coronal magnetic field (Craig, 2001). Statistical flare observations then derive from a multiplicity of independent sites, flaring in parallel, that produce events of widely varying output (Wheatland, 2002). Given that the `separator length' at an individual site controls the event frequency and the mean energy release, it is shown that the observed frequency-energy spectrum N(E)can be inverted to yield a source function that relates directly to the distribution of separator lengths. It is also pointed out that, under the parallel flaring model, inferred waiting-time distributions are naturally interpreted as a superposition of individual point processes. Only a modest number of flaring separators is required to mimic a Poisson process.},

We analyzed solar flare data in 55 active regions that are listed in the Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) soft X-ray flare catalog for the years from 1981 to 2005. We discuss some problems with a conventional procedure to derive probability density functions from any data set and propose a new procedure, which uses the maximum likelihood method and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to objectively compare some competing probability density functions. Previous studies of the solar flare interval distribution in individual active regions only dealt with constant or time-dependent Poisson process models, and no other models were discussed. We examine three models – exponential, lognormal, and inverse Gaussian – as competing models for probability density functions in this study. We found that lognormal and inverse Gaussian models are more likely models than the exponential model for the solar flare interval distribution in individual active regions. The possible solar flare mechanisms for the distribution models are briefly mentioned. We also briefly investigated the time dependence of probability density functions of the solar flare interval distribution and found that some active regions show time dependence for lognormal and inverse Gaussian distribution functions. The results suggest that solar flares do not occur randomly in time; rather, solar flare intervals appear to be regulated by solar flare mechanisms. Determining a solar flare interval distribution is an essential step in probabilistic solar flare forecasting methods in space weather research. We briefly mention a probabilistic solar flare forecasting method as an application of a solar flare interval distribution analysis. The application of our distribution analysis to a probabilistic solar flare forecasting method is one of the main objectives of this study.},

A 'build-up and release' (BUR) scenario for magnetic energy storage in the solar corona suggests the existence of such a relationship, relating the slowly varying subphotospheric energy sources to the sudden coronal energy releases of flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Substantial amounts of research effort had not previously found any obvious observational evidence for such a BUR process. This has posed a puzzle since coronal magnetic energy storage represents the consensus view of the basic flare mechanism. We have revisited the GOES soft X-ray flare statistics for any evidence of correlations, using two isolated active regions, and have found significant evidence for a 'saturation' correlation. Rather than a 'reset' form of this relaxation, in which the time before a flare correlates with its magnitude, the 'saturation' relationship results in the time after the flare showing the correlation. The observed correlation competes with the 'obscuration' effect of reduced GOES sensitivity following a strong event, by which weaker events can be under-reported systematically. This complicates the observed correlation, and we discuss several approaches to remedy this.},

It is shown that the power-law index γ varies with the solar cycle. For the minimum phase of the cycle the index is γ=-1.4+/-0.1, and for the maximum phase of the cycle the index is -3.2+/-0.2. For all years 1975-2001, the index is -2.2+/-0.1. We present a simple theory to account for the observed waiting-time distributions in terms of a Poisson process with a time-varying rate λ(t). A common approximation of slow variation of the rate with respect to a waiting time is examined, and found to be valid for the GOES catalog events. Subject to this approximation the observed waiting-time distribution is determined by f(λ), the time distribution of the rate λ. If f(λ) has a power-law form {\textasciitilde}λα for low rates, the waiting time-distribution is predicted to have a power-law tail {\textasciitilde}(Δt)-(3+α) (α{\textgreater}-3). Distributions f(λ) are constructed from the GOES data. For the entire catalog a power-law index α=-0.9+/-0.1 is found in the time distribution of rates for low rates (λ{\textless}0.1hours-1). For the maximum and minimum phases power-law indices α=-0.1+/-0.5 and α=-1.7+/-0.2, respectively, are observed. Hence, the Poisson theory together with the observed time distributions of the rate predict power-law tails in the waiting-time distributions with indices -2.2+/-0.1 (1975-2001), -2.9+/-0.5 (maximum phase) and -1.3+/-0.2 (minimum phase), consistent with the observations. These results suggest that the flaring rate varies in an intrinsically different way at solar maximum by comparison with solar minimum. The implications of these results for a recent model for flare statistics (Craig, 2001) and more generally for our understanding of the flare process are discussed.},

First, we find that these structures are self-similar, and have neither a characteristic magnitude, nor a characteristic duration. Their waiting time statistics show evidence of aggregation. The associated long memory resides in their occurrence rate, and is not inherent to the background fluctuations. Interestingly, the spectral properties of inertial range turbulence differ inside and outside of switchback structures; in the latter the 1/f range extends to higher frequencies. These results suggest that outside of these structures we are in the presence of lower-amplitude fluctuations with a shorter turbulent inertial range.

We find a close correlation between the waiting-time power-law slope ατ and the sunspot number (SN), i.e., ατ = 1.38 + 0.01 × SN. The waiting-time distribution can be fitted with a Pareto-type function of the form N(τ) = N0 \$\{(\{{\textbackslash}tau \}\_\{0\}+{\textbackslash}tau )\}{\textasciicircum}\{-\{{\textbackslash}alpha \}\_\{{\textbackslash}tau \}\}\$ , where the offset τ0 depends on the instrumental sensitivity, the detection threshold of events, and pulse pileup effects. The time-dependent power-law slope ατ(t) of waiting-time distributions depends only on the global solar magnetic flux (quantified by the sunspot number) or flaring rate, which is not predicted by self-organized criticality or magnetohydrodynamic turbulence models. Power-law slopes of ατ ≍ 1.2-1.6 were also found in solar wind switchback events, as observed with the Parker Solar Probe during the solar minimum, while steeper slopes are predicted during the solar maximum. We find that the annual variability of switchback events in the heliospheric solar wind and solar flare and CME rates (originating in the photosphere and lower corona) are highly correlated.},

	abstract = {In this study we aim for a deeper understanding of the power-law slope, α, of waiting time distributions. Statistically independent events with linear behavior can be characterized by binomial, Gaussian, exponential, or Poissonian size distribution functions. In contrast, physical processes with nonlinear behavior exhibit spatiotemporal coherence (or memory) and "fat tails" in their size distributions that fit power-law-like functions, as a consequence of the time variability of the mean event rate, as demonstrated by means of Bayesian block decomposition in the work of Wheatland et al. In this study we conduct numerical simulations of waiting time distributions N(τ) in a large parameter space for various (polynomial, sinusoidal, Gaussian) event rate functions λ(t), parameterized with an exponent p that expresses the degree of the polynomial function λ(t) ∝ tp. We derive an analytical exact solution of the waiting time distribution function in terms of the incomplete gamma function, which is similar to a Pareto type II function and has a power-law slope of α = 2 + 1/p, in the asymptotic limit of large waiting times. Numerically simulated random distributions reproduce this theoretical prediction accurately. Numerical simulations in the nonlinear regime (p ≥ 2) predict power-law slopes in the range of 2.0 ≤ α ≤ 2.5. The self-organized criticality model yields a prediction of α = 2. Observations of solar flares and coronal mass ejections (over at least a half solar cycle) are found in the range of αobs ≍ 2.1-2.4. Deviations from strict power-law functions are expected due to the variability of the flare event rate λ(t), and deviations from theoretically predicted slope values α occur due to the Poissonian weighting bias of power-law fits.},

Out of the 1439 flares on 216 different stars detected in the short-cadence data using an automated search, 56 flares are found to have pronounced QPP-like signatures in the light curve, of which 11 have stable decaying oscillations. No correlation is found between the QPP period and the stellar temperature, radius, rotation period and surface gravity, suggesting that the QPPs are independent of global stellar parameters. Hence they are likely to be the result of processes occurring in the local environment. There is also no significant correlation between the QPP period and flare energy, however there is evidence that the period scales with the QPP decay time for the Gaussian damping scenario, but not to a significant degree for the exponentially damped case. This same scaling has been observed for MHD oscillations on the Sun, suggesting that they could be the cause of the QPPs in those flares. Scaling laws of the flare energy are also investigated, supporting previous reports of a strong correlation between the flare energy and stellar temperature/radius. A negative correlation between the flare energy and stellar surface gravity is also found.},

	abstract = {The cause of quasi-periodic pulsations in solar flares remains the subject of debate. Recently, Nakariakov \& Zimovets proposed a new model suggesting that, in two-ribbon flares, such pulsations could be explained by propagating slow waves. These waves may travel obliquely to the magnetic field, reflect in the chromosphere, and constructively interfere at a spatially separate site in the corona, leading to quasi-periodic reconnection events progressing along the flaring arcade. Such a slow wave regime would have certain observational characteristics. We search for evidence of this phenomenon during a selection of two-ribbon flares observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, and Transition Region and Coronal Explorer; the flares of 2002 November 9, 2005 January 19, and 2005 August 22. We were not able to observe a clear correlation between hard X-ray footpoint separations and pulse timings during these events. Also, the motion of hard X-ray footpoints is shown to be continuous within the observational error, whereas a discontinuous motion might be anticipated in the slow wave model. Finally, we find that for a preferential slow wave propagation angle of 25°-28° that is expected for the fastest waves, the velocities of the hard X-ray footpoints lead to estimated pulse periods and ribbon lengths significantly larger than the measured values. Hence, for the three events studied, we conclude that the observational characteristics cannot be easily explained via the Nakariakov \& Zimovets propagating slow wave model when only angles of 25°-28° are considered. We provide suggested flare parameters to optimize future studies of this kind.},

The soft X-ray light curve (0.2-12 keV) is investigated with wavelet analysis. The flare's extended, flat peak shows clear evidence for a damped oscillation with a period of around 750 s, an exponential damping time of around 2000 s, and an initial, relative peak-to-peak amplitude of around 15\%. We suggest that the oscillation is a standing magneto-acoustic wave tied to the flare loop, and find that the most likely interpretation is a longitudinal, slow-mode wave, with a resulting loop length of (2.5 ± 0.2)×10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} cm. The local magnetic field strength is found to be 105 ± 50 G. These values are consistent with (oscillation-independent) flare cooling time models and pressure balance scaling laws. Such a flare oscillation provides an excellent opportunity to obtain coronal properties like the size of a flare loop or the local magnetic field strength for the otherwise spatially-unresolved star.},

We use the standard wavelet tool, and find the oscillation period of {\textasciitilde}587 s near the loop apex, and {\textasciitilde}349 s near the footpoint.

The standard model of magnetic configuration of CTTS predicts that coronal magnetic flux tubes connect the stellar atmosphere to the inner region of the disk. However, differential rotation may disrupt these long loops. The results from hydrodynamic modeling of X-ray flares observed in CTTS that confirm the star-disk connection hypothesis are still controversial.

The observed loop oscillations occurred during a flare that began at 1998 July 14, 12:55 UT and are most prominent during the first 20 minutes. The oscillating loops connect the penumbra of the leading sunspot to the flare site in the trailing portion. We identified five oscillating loops with an average length of L=130,000+/-30,000 km. The transverse amplitude of the oscillations is A=4100+/-1300 km, and the mean period is T=280+/-30 s. The oscillation mode appears to be a standing wave mode (with fixed nodes at the footpoints). We investigate different MHD wave modes and find that the fast kink mode with a period τ=205(L/1010 cm)(ne/109 cm-3)1/2(B/10 G)-1 s provides the best agreement with the observed period. We propose that the onset of loop oscillations in distant locations is triggered by a signal or disturbance that propagates from the central flare site with a radial speed of {\textasciitilde}700 km s-1. Because the observed loop oscillation periods are comparable to photospheric 5 minute oscillations, a resonant coupling between the two systems is possible. We further find evidence for global extreme-UV dimming in the entire active region possibly associated with a coronal mass ejection.},

Northern hemisphere SARs dominated in solar cycles 19 and 20 and southern hemisphere SARs dominated in solar cycles 21 and 22. In solar cycle 23, however, SARs occurred about equally in each hemisphere. There are two active longitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres, about 160°-200° apart. Applying the improved dynamic reference frame to SARs, we find that SARs rotate faster than the Carrington rate and there is no significant difference between the two hemispheres. The synodic periods are 27.19 days and 27.25 days for the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively. The longitudinal distribution of SARs is significantly non-axisymmetric and about 75\% SARs occurred near two active longitudes with half widths of 45°. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Appendix A is available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

The planet was recently discovered from preliminary analysis of radial-velocity observations and confirmed to be transiting its host star from photometric data from the NASA's TESS mission. We obtained radial-velocity measurements of AU Mic over the course of two partially observable transits and one full transit of planet b from high-resolution spectroscopic observations made with the MINERVA-Australis telescope array. Only a marginal detection of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect signal was obtained from the radial velocities, in part due to AU Mic being an extremely active star and the lack of full transit coverage plus sufficient out-of-transit baseline. As such, a precise determination of the obliquity for AU Mic b is not possible in this study and we find a sky-projected spin-orbit angle of \${\textbackslash}lambda =\{47\}\_\{-54\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{+26\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\} \$ . This result is consistent with both the planet's orbit being aligned or highly misaligned with the spin axis of its host star. Our measurement independently agrees with, but is far less precise than observations carried out on other instruments around the same time that measure a low-obliquity orbit for the planet. AU Mic is the youngest exoplanetary system for which the projected spin-orbit angle has been measured, making it a key data point in the study of the formation and migration of exoplanets-particularly given that the system is also host to a bright debris disk.},

We used the high-dispersion near-infrared spectrograph InfraRed Doppler (IRD) on the Subaru telescope to detect the Doppler "shadow" from the planet and constrain the projected stellar obliquity.

	abstract = {It is widely assumed that a star and its protoplanetary disk are initially aligned, with the stellar equator parallel to the disk plane. When observations reveal a misalignment between stellar rotation and the orbital motion of a planet, the usual interpretation is that the initial alignment was upset by gravitational perturbations that took place after planet formation. Most of the previously known misalignments involve isolated hot Jupiters, for which planet-planet scattering or secular effects from a wider-orbiting planet are the leading explanations. In theory, star/disk misalignments can result from turbulence during star formation or the gravitational torque of a wide-orbiting companion star, but no definite examples of this scenario are known. An ideal example would combine a coplanar system of multiple planets—ruling out planet-planet scattering or other disruptive postformation events—with a backward-rotating star, a condition that is easier to obtain from a primordial misalignment than from postformation perturbations. There are two previously known examples of a misaligned star in a coplanar multiplanet system, but in neither case has a suitable companion star been identified, nor is the stellar rotation known to be retrograde. Here, we show that the star K2-290 A is tilted by 124° ± 6° compared with the orbits of both of its known planets and has a wide-orbiting stellar companion that is capable of having tilted the protoplanetary disk. The system provides the clearest demonstration that stars and protoplanetary disks can become grossly misaligned due to the gravitational torque from a neighboring star.},

	abstract = {It has been known for a decade that hot stars with hot Jupiters tend to have high obliquities. Less is known about the degree of spin-orbit alignment for hot stars with other kinds of planets. Here, we reassess the obliquities of hot Kepler stars with transiting planets smaller than Neptune, based on spectroscopic measurements of their projected rotation velocities ( \$v{\textbackslash}sin i\$ ). The basis of the method is that a lower obliquity—all other things being equal—causes \${\textbackslash}sin i\$ to be closer to unity and increases the value of \$v{\textbackslash}sin i\$ . We sought evidence for this effect using a sample of 150 Kepler stars with effective temperatures between 5950 and 6550 K and a control sample of 101 stars with matching spectroscopic properties and random orientations. The planet hosts have systematically higher values of \$v{\textbackslash}sin i\$ than the control stars, but not by enough to be compatible with perfect spin-orbit alignment. The mean value of \${\textbackslash}sin i\$ is 0.856 ± 0.036, which is 4σ away from unity (perfect alignment), and 2σ away from \${\textbackslash}pi /4\$ (random orientations). There is also evidence that the hottest stars have a broader obliquity distribution: when modeled separately, the stars cooler than 6250 K have \$ {\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}sin i {\textbackslash}rangle =0.928{\textbackslash}pm 0.042\$ while the hotter stars are consistent with random orientations. This is similar to the pattern previously noted for stars with hot Jupiters. Based on these results, obliquity excitation for early-G and late-F stars appears to be a general outcome of star and planet formation, rather than being exclusively linked to hot Jupiter formation. * The data presented herein were obtained at the W.

Exoplanets orbiting close to cool stars are expected to be on circular, aligned orbits because of strong tidal interactions with the stellar convective envelope. Spin-orbit alignment can be measured when the planet transits its star, but such ground-based spectroscopic measurements are challenging for cool, slowly rotating stars. Here we report the three-dimensional characterization of the trajectory of an exoplanet around an M dwarf star, derived by mapping the spectrum of the stellar photosphere along the chord transited by the planet. We find that the eccentric orbit of the Neptune-mass exoplanet GJ 436b is nearly perpendicular to the stellar equator. Both eccentricity and misalignment, surprising around a cool star, can result from dynamical interactions (via Kozai migration) with a yet-undetected outer companion. This inward migration of GJ 436b could have triggered the atmospheric escape that now sustains its giant exosphere.},

	abstract = {The observed amplitude of the rotational photometric modulation of a star with spots should depend on the inclination of its rotational axis relative to our line of sight. Therefore, the distribution of observed rotational amplitudes of a large sample of stars depends on the distribution of their projected axes of rotation. Thus, comparison of the stellar rotational amplitudes of the Kepler objects of interest (KOIs) with those of Kepler single stars can provide a measure to indirectly infer the properties of the spin-orbit obliquity of Kepler planets. We apply this technique to the large samples of 993 KOIs and 33,614 single Kepler stars in temperature range of 3500-6500 K. We find with high significance that the amplitudes of cool KOIs are larger, on the order of 10\%, than those of the single stars. In contrast, the amplitudes of hot KOIs are systematically lower. After correcting for an observational bias, we estimate that the amplitudes of the hot KOIs are smaller than the single stars by about the same factor of 10\%. The border line between the relatively larger and smaller amplitudes, relative to the amplitudes of the single stars, occurs at about 6000 K. Our results suggest that the cool stars have their planets aligned with their stellar rotation, while the planets around hot stars have large obliquities, consistent with the findings of Winn et al. and Albrecht et al. We show that the low obliquity of the planets around cool stars extends up to at least 50 days, a feature that is not expected in the framework of a model that assumes the low obliquity is due to planet-star tidal realignment.},

We have carried out test-particle simulations of ∼GeV protons to investigate the propagation of energetic particles accelerated by flares or traveling shock waves within the stellar wind and magnetic field of a TRAPPIST-1-like system. Turbulence was simulated with small-scale magnetostatic perturbations with an isotropic power spectrum. We find that only a few percent of particles injected within half a stellar radius from the stellar surface escape, and that the escaping fraction increases strongly with increasing injection radius. Escaping particles are increasingly deflected and focused by the ambient spiraling magnetic field as the superimposed turbulence amplitude is increased. In our TRAPPIST-1-like simulations, regardless of the angular region of injection, particles are strongly focused onto two caps within the fast wind regions and centered on the equatorial planetary orbital plane. Based on a scaling relation between far-UV emission and energetic protons for solar flares applied to M dwarfs, the innermost putative habitable planet, TRAPPIST-1e, is bombarded by a proton flux up to 6 orders of magnitude larger than experienced by the present-day Earth. We note two mechanisms that could strongly limit EP fluxes from active stars: EPs from flares are contained by the stellar magnetic field; and potential CMEs that might generate EPs at larger distances also fail to escape.},

In the course of these investigations several peak size distribution functions based on Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) measurements of both quantities have been developed.

However, a comparison of the existing peak size distribution functions reveals strong discrepancies with respect to each other. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The aim of this paper is to derive a new peak size distribution function that can be utilized to give a more realistic estimate of the stellar proton flux of G-, K-, and M-dwarf stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: By updating and extending the GOES-based peak size distribution down to B-class X-ray flare intensities with the help of SphinX data from the solar minimum conditions of 2009 and newly derived GOES data between 1975 and 2005, we developed a new power-law peak size distribution function for solar proton fluxes (E \&gt; 10 MeV). However, its resulting slope differs from values reported in the literature. Therefore, we also developed a double-power-law peak size distribution function. An extension to much higher X-ray flare intensities (10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}) W m{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} and above, for the first time, results in an approximation of best- and worst-case scenarios of the stellar proton flux around G-, K-, and M-dwarf stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Investigating the impact of the newly developed peak size distribution function for G-, K-, and M-dwarf star flare intensities we show that in the worst-case scenario previous studies may underestimate the stellar proton flux by roughly one to five orders of magnitude.},

Our findings are as follows. (1) The sum of the mean nonthermal energy of flare-accelerated particles (\{E\}\{nt\}), the energy of direct heating (\{E\}\{dir\}), and the energy in CMEs (\{E\}\{CME\}), which are the primary energy dissipation processes in a flare, is found to have a ratio of (\{E\}\{nt\}+\{E\}\{dir\}+\{E\}\{CME\})/\{E\}\{mag\}=0.87+/- 0.18, compared with the dissipated magnetic free energy \{E\}\{mag\}, which confirms energy closure within the measurement uncertainties and corroborates the magnetic origin of flares and CMEs. (2) The energy partition of the dissipated magnetic free energy is: 0.51 ± 0.17 in nonthermal energy of ≥slant 6 \{keV\} electrons, 0.17 ± 0.17 in nonthermal ≥slant 1 \{MeV\} ions, 0.07 ± 0.14 in CMEs, and 0.07 ± 0.17 in direct heating. (3) The thermal energy is almost always less than the nonthermal energy, which is consistent with the thick-target model. (4) The bolometric luminosity in white-light flares is comparable to the thermal energy in soft X-rays (SXR). (5) Solar energetic particle events carry a fraction ≈ 0.03 of the CME energy, which is consistent with CME-driven shock acceleration. (6) The warm-target model predicts a lower limit of the low-energy cutoff at \{e\}c≈ 6 \{keV\}, based on the mean peak temperature of the differential emission measure of T e = 8.6 MK during flares. This work represents the first statistical study that establishes energy closure in solar flare/CME events.},

	abstract = {Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on stars other than the Sun have proven very difficult to detect. One promising pathway lies in the detection of type II radio bursts. Their appearance and distinctive properties are associated with the development of an outward propagating CME-driven shock. However, dedicated radio searches have not been able to identify these transient features in other stars. Large Alfvén speeds and the magnetic suppression of CMEs in active stars have been proposed to render stellar eruptions "radio-quiet." Employing 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study the distribution of the coronal Alfvén speed, focusing on two cases representative of a young Sun-like star and a mid-activity M-dwarf (Proxima Centauri). These results are compared with a standard solar simulation and used to characterize the shock-prone regions in the stellar corona and wind. Furthermore, using a flux-rope eruption model, we drive realistic CME events within our M-dwarf simulation. We consider eruptions with different energies to probe the regimes of weak and partial CME magnetic confinement. While these CMEs are able to generate shocks in the corona, those are pushed much farther out compared to their solar counterparts. This drastically reduces the resulting type II radio burst frequencies down to the ionospheric cutoff, which impedes their detection with ground-based instrumentation.},

Our analysis indicates that a clear, novel, and observable, coronal response is generated due to the collapse of the eruption and its eventual release into the stellar wind. Escaping CME events, weakly suppressed by the large-scale field, induce a flare-like signature in the emission from coronal material at different temperatures due to compression and associated heating. Such flare-like profiles display a distinctive temporal evolution in their Doppler shift signal (from red to blue), as the eruption first collapses toward the star and then perturbs the ambient magnetized plasma on its way outwards. For stellar fields providing partial confinement, CME fragmentation takes place, leading to rise and fall flow patterns which resemble the solar coronal rain cycle. In strongly suppressed events, the response is better described as a gradual brightening, in which the failed CME is deposited in the form of a coronal rain cloud leading to a much slower rise in the ambient high-energy flux by relatively small factors (∼2-3). In all the considered cases (escaping/confined) a fractional decrease in the emission from midrange coronal temperature plasma occurs, similar to the coronal dimming events observed on the Sun. Detection of the observational signatures of these CME-induced features requires a sensitive next generation X-ray space telescope.},

	abstract = {Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) remain observationally elusive, but could have important implications for exoplanet habitability. Low-frequency radio bursts, known as Type IIs in the solar context, offer the best means to identify stellar CMEs, determine their occurrence rates, and characterize their properties. We report on 44 hr of observation of the nearby, magnetically active, and well-characterized M-dwarf star binary EQ Peg. The observations are taken with the Jansky Very Large Array’s P-band (230-470 MHz) receiver in both its B and C configurations. Two radio transient events were detected, one in each configuration. Both bursts lasted on the order of 20 minutes between 275 and 350 MHz, had a median polarization of ∼30\%, and have a frequency drift rate of ∼10 kHz. These two events are likely not type II bursts as their properties do not match expected parameters based on coronal models for each star. This work and the work of Crosley \& Osten represent a combined 64 hr for the longest timescale search of a single star for radio transients at low frequencies to date, and casts serious doubt on the assumption that a high flaring rate corresponds to a high rate of CMEs.},

We used two CME catalogs: one provided by the Coordinated Data Analysis Workshops (CDAW) Data Center and one obtained by the Computer Aided CME Tracking software (CACTus) detection algorithm. For each dataset, we found that the number of CMEs observed during the peak of Cycle 24 was higher than or comparable to the number during Cycle 23, although the photospheric activity during Cycle 24 was weaker than during Cycle 23. Using the CMEs detected by CACTus, we noted that the number of events [N] is of the same order of magnitude during the peaks of the two cycles, but the peak of the CME distribution during Cycle 24 is more extended in time (N {\textgreater} 1500 during 2012 and 2013). We ascribe the discrepancy between the CDAW and CACTus results to the observer bias for CME definition in the CDAW catalog. We also used a dataset containing 19,811 flares of C-, M-, and X-class observed by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) during the same period. Using both datasets, we studied the relationship between the mass ejected by the CMEs and the flux emitted during the corresponding flares: we found 11,441 flares that were temporally correlated with CMEs for CDAW and 9120 for CACTus. Moreover, we found a log-linear relationship between the flux of the flares integrated from the start to end in the 0.1 - 0.8 nm range and the CME mass. We also found some differences in the mean CMEs velocity and acceleration between the events associated with flares and those that were not.},

	abstract = {Solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and flares have a statistically well-defined relationship, with more energetic X-ray flares corresponding to faster and more massive CMEs. How this relationship extends to more magnetically active stars is a subject of open research. Here we study the most probable stellar CME candidates associated with flares captured in the literature to date, all of which were observed on magnetically active stars. We use a simple CME model to derive masses and kinetic energies from observed quantities and transform associated flare data to the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 1-8 Å band. Derived CME masses range from ∼1015 to 1022 g. Associated flare X-ray energies range from 1031 to 1037 erg. Stellar CME masses as a function of associated flare energy generally lie along or below the extrapolated mean for solar events. In contrast, CME kinetic energies lie below the analogous solar extrapolation by roughly 2 orders of magnitude, indicating approximate parity between flare X-ray and CME kinetic energies. These results suggest that the CMEs associated with very energetic flares on active stars are more limited in terms of the ejecta velocity than the ejecta mass, possibly because of the restraining influence of strong overlying magnetic fields and stellar wind drag. Lower CME kinetic energies and velocities present a more optimistic scenario for the effects of CME impacts on exoplanets in close proximity to active stellar hosts.},

Here, we aim to estimate the maximum possible Balmer line fluxes expected from CMEs to infer their detectability in spectroscopic observations. Moreover, we use these results together with a model of intrinsic CME rates to infer the potentially observable CME rates for stars of different spectral types under various observing conditions, as well as the minimum required observing time to detect stellar CMEs in Balmer lines. We find that generally CME detection is favoured for mid- to late-type M dwarfs, as they require the lowest signal-to-noise ratio for CME detection, and the fraction of observable-to-intrinsic CMEs is largest. They may require, however, longer observing times than stars of earlier spectral types at the same activity level, as their predicted intrinsic CME rates are lower. CME detections are generally favoured for stars close to the saturation regime, because they are expected to have the highest intrinsic rates; the predicted minimum observing time to detect CMEs on just moderately active stars is already {\textgreater}100 h. By comparison with spectroscopic data sets including detections as well as non-detections of CMEs, we find that our modelled maximum observable CME rates are generally consistent with these observations on adopting parameters within the ranges determined by observations of solar and stellar prominences.},

	abstract = {Solar eruptive phenomena embrace a variety of eruptions, including flares, solar energetic particles, and radio bursts. Since the vast majority of these are associated with the eruption, development, and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we focus on CME observations in this review. CMEs are a key aspect of coronal and interplanetary dynamics. They inject large quantities of mass and magnetic flux into the heliosphere, causing major transient disturbances. CMEs can drive interplanetary shocks, a key source of solar energetic particles and are known to be the major contributor to severe space weather at the Earth. Studies over the past decade using the data sets from (among others) the SOHO, TRACE, Wind, ACE, STEREO, and SDO spacecraft, along with ground-based instruments, have improved our knowledge of the origins and development of CMEs at the Sun and how they contribute to space weather at Earth. SOHO, launched in 1995, has provided us with almost continuous coverage of the solar corona over more than a complete solar cycle, and the heliospheric imagers SMEI (2003-2011) and the HIs (operating since early 2007) have provided us with the capability to image and track CMEs continually across the inner heliosphere. We review some key coronal properties of CMEs, their source regions and their propagation through the solar wind. The LASCO coronagraphs routinely observe CMEs launched along the Sun-Earth line as halo-like brightenings. STEREO also permits observing Earth-directed CMEs from three different viewpoints of increasing azimuthal separation, thereby enabling the estimation of their three-dimensional properties. These are important not only for space weather prediction purposes, but also for understanding the development and internal structure of CMEs since we view their source regions on the solar disk and can measure their in-situ characteristics along their axes. Included in our discussion of the recent developments in CME-related phenomena are the latest developments from the STEREO and LASCO coronagraphs and the SMEI and HI heliospheric imagers.},

They are powered by magnetospheric current systems that lead to the precipitation of energetic electrons into the high-latitude regions of the upper atmosphere. In the case of the gas-giant planets, these aurorae include highly polarized radio emission at kilohertz and megahertz frequencies produced by the precipitating electrons, as well as continuum and line emission in the infrared, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray parts of the spectrum, associated with the collisional excitation and heating of the hydrogen-dominated atmosphere. Here we report simultaneous radio and optical spectroscopic observations of an object at the end of the stellar main sequence, located right at the boundary between stars and brown dwarfs, from which we have detected radio and optical auroral emissions both powered by magnetospheric currents. Whereas the magnetic activity of stars like our Sun is powered by processes that occur in their lower atmospheres, these aurorae are powered by processes originating much further out in the magnetosphere of the dwarf star that couple energy into the lower atmosphere. The dissipated power is at least four orders of magnitude larger than what is produced in the Jovian magnetosphere, revealing aurorae to be a potentially ubiquitous signature of large-scale magnetospheres that can scale to luminosities far greater than those observed in our Solar System. These magnetospheric current systems may also play a part in powering some of the weather phenomena reported on brown dwarfs.},

For the other 24 targets, we confirm previously reported measurements. We find that 13 stars from our sample have v sin i below our measurement threshold (12 km s-1) whereas four of our targets are fast rotators (v sin i {\textgreater} 30 km s-1). As fast rotation causes spectral features to be washed out, stars with low projected rotational velocities are sought for radial velocity surveys. At our intermediate spectral resolution, we have confirmed the identification of neutral atomic lines reported in McLean et al. We also calculated pseudo-equivalent widths of 12 atomic lines. Our results confirm that the pseudo-equivalent width of K I lines is strongly dependent on spectral types. We observe that the pseudo-equivalent width of Fe I and Mn I lines remains fairly constant with later spectral type. We suggest that these lines are particularly suitable for deriving metallicities for late M dwarfs.},

LSR J1835+3259 is an M8.5 dwarf exhibiting transient radio and optical emission bursts modulated by fast rotation. We have detected the surface magnetic field as circularly polarized signatures in the 819 nm sodium lines when an active emission region faced the Earth. Modeling Stokes profiles of these lines reveals the effective temperature of 2800 K and log gravity acceleration of 4.5. These parameters place LSR J1835+3259 on evolutionary tracks as a young brown dwarf with the mass of 55+/- 4\{M\}\{\{J\}\} and age of 22 ± 4 Myr. Its magnetic field is at least 5.1 kG and covers at least 11\% of the visible hemisphere. The active region topology recovered using line profile inversions comprises hot plasma loops with a vertical stratification of optical and radio emission sources. These loops rotate with the dwarf in and out of view causing periodic emission bursts. The magnetic field is detected at the base of the loops. This is the first time that we can quantitatively associate brown dwarf non-thermal bursts with a strong, 5 kG surface magnetic field and solve the puzzle of their driving mechanism. This is also the coolest known dwarf with such a strong surface magnetic field. The young age of LSR J1835+3259 implies that it may still maintain a disk, which may facilitate bursts via magnetospheric accretion, like in higher-mass T Tau-type stars. Our results pave a path toward magnetic studies of brown dwarfs and hot Jupiters.},

As has previously been reported for the M9 dwarf TVLM 513-46546, periodic pulses of 100\% circularly polarized, coherent radio emission are detected from both dwarfs with periods of 2.84 +/- 0.01 and 3.08 +/- 0.05 hr, respectively, for LSR J1835+3259 and 2MASS J00361617+1821104. Importantly, periodic unpolarized radio emission is also detected from 2MASS J00361617+1821104, and brightness temperature limitations rule out gyrosynchrotron radiation as a source of this radio emission. The unpolarized emission from this and other ultracool dwarfs is also attributed to electron cyclotron maser emission, which has become depolarized on traversing the ultracool dwarf magnetosphere, possibly due to propagations effects such as scattering. Based on available vsin i data in the literature and rotation periods derived from the periodic radio data for the three confirmed sources of electron cyclotron maser emission, TVLM 513-46546, LSR J1835+3259, and 2MASS J00361617+1821104, we determine that the rotation axes of all three dwarfs are close to perpendicular to our line of sight. This suggests a possible geometrical selection effect due to the inherent directivity of electron cyclotron maser emission, that may account for the previously reported relationship between radio activity and vsin i observed for ultracool dwarfs. We also determine the radius of the dwarf LSR J1835+3259 to be {\textgreater}=0.117 +/- 0.012 R⊙. The implied size of the radius, together with the bolometric luminosity of the dwarf, suggests that either LSR J1835 is a young- or intermediate-age brown dwarf, or that current theoretical models underestimate the radii of ultracool dwarfs.},

	abstract = {We report in this paper phase-resolved spectropolarimetric observations of the rapidly rotating fully convective M4 dwarf V374 Peg, on which a strong, mainly axisymmetric, large-scale poloidal magnetic field was recently detected. In addition to the original data set secured in 2005 August, we present here new data collected in 2005 September and 2006 August. From the rotational modulation of unpolarized line profiles, we conclude that star-spots are present at the surface of the star, but their contrast and fractional coverage are much lower than those of non-fully convective active stars with similar rotation rate. Applying tomographic imaging on each set of circularly polarized profiles separately, we find that the large-scale magnetic topology is remarkably stable on a time-scale of 1 yr; repeating the analysis on the complete data set suggests that the magnetic configuration is sheared by very weak differential rotation (about 1/10th of the solar surface shear) and only slightly distorted by intrinsic variability. This result is at odds with various theoretical predictions, suggesting that dynamo fields of fully convective stars should be mostly non-axisymmetric unless they succeed at triggering significant differential rotation.

	abstract = {Low-mass stars are known to have magnetic fields that are believed to be of dynamo origin. Two complementary techniques are principally used to characterize them. Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) can determine the geometry of the large-scale magnetic field while Zeeman broadening can assess the total unsigned flux including that associated with small-scale structures such as spots. In this work, we study a sample of stars that have been previously mapped with ZDI. We show that the average unsigned magnetic flux follows an activity-rotation relation separating into saturated and unsaturated regimes. We also compare the average photospheric magnetic flux recovered by ZDI, {\textless} \{B\}V{\textgreater} , with that recovered by Zeeman broadening studies, {\textless} \{B\}I{\textgreater} . In line with previous studies, {\textless} \{B\}V{\textgreater} ranges from a few \% to ∼20\% of {\textless} \{B\}I{\textgreater} . We show that a power-law relationship between {\textless} \{B\}V{\textgreater} and {\textless} \{B\}I{\textgreater} exists and that ZDI recovers a larger fraction of the magnetic flux in more active stars. Using this relation, we improve on previous attempts to estimate filling factors, i.e., the fraction of the stellar surface covered with magnetic field, for stars mapped only with ZDI. Our estimated filling factors follow the well-known activity-rotation relation, which is in agreement with filling factors obtained directly from Zeeman broadening studies. We discuss the possible implications of these results for flux tube expansion above the stellar surface and stellar wind models.},

	abstract = {Context. Magnetic fields in cool stars can be investigated by measuring Zeeman line broadening and polarization in atomic and molecular lines. Similar to the Sun, these fields are complex and height-dependent. Many molecular lines dominating M-dwarf spectra (e.g., FeH, CaH, MgH, and TiO) are temperature- and Zeeman-sensitive and form at different atmospheric heights, which makes them excellent probes of magnetic fields on M dwarfs. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Our goal is to analyze the complexity of magnetic fields in M dwarfs. We investigate how magnetic fields vary with the stellar temperature and how "surface" inhomogeneities are distributed in height - the dimension that is usually neglected in stellar magnetic studies. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We have determined effective temperatures of the photosphere and of magnetic features, magnetic field strengths and filling factors for nine M dwarfs (M1-M7). Our χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} analysis is based on a comparison of observed and synthetic intensity and circular polarization profiles. Stokes profiles were calculated by solving polarized radiative transfer equations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Properties of magnetic structures depend on the analyzed atomic or molecular species and their formation heights. Two types of magnetic features similar to those on the Sun have been found: a cooler (starspots) and a hotter (network) one. The magnetic field strength in both starspots and network is within 3-6 kG, on average it is 5 kG. These fields occupy a large fraction of M dwarf atmospheres at all heights, up to 100\%. The plasma β is less than one, implying highly magnetized stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: A combination of molecular and atomic species and a simultaneous analysis of intensity and circular polarization spectra have allowed us to better decipher the complexity of magnetic fields on M dwarfs, including their dependence on the atmospheric height.

	abstract = {M dwarfs are the most numerous stars in our Galaxy, with masses between approximately 0.5 and 0.1 solar masses. Many of them show surface activity qualitatively similar to our Sun and generate flares, high X-ray fluxes and large-scale magnetic fields1,2,3,4. Such activity is driven by a dynamo powered by the convective motions in their interiors2,5,6,7,8. Understanding properties of stellar magnetic fields in these stars finds a broad application in astrophysics, including theory of stellar dynamos and environment conditions around planets that may be orbiting these stars. Most stars with convective envelopes follow a rotation-activity relationship where various activity indicators saturate in stars with rotation periods shorter than a few days2,6,8. The activity gradually declines with rotation rate in stars rotating more slowly. It is thought that, due to a tight empirical correlation between X-ray radiance and magnetic flux9, the stellar magnetic fields will also saturate, to values around 4 kG (ref. 10). Here we report the detection of magnetic fields above the presumed saturation limit in four fully convective M dwarfs. By combining results from spectroscopic and polarimetric studies, we explain our findings in terms of bistable dynamo models11,12: stars with the strongest magnetic fields are those in a dipole dynamo state, whereas stars in a multipole state cannot generate fields stronger than about 4 kG. Our study provides observational evidence that the dynamo in fully convective M dwarfs generates magnetic fields that can differ not only in the geometry of their large-scale component, but also in the total magnetic energy.},

	abstract = {Context. Flares are powerful events ignited by a sudden release of magnetic energy which triggers a cascade of interconnected phenomena, each resulting in emission in different electromagnetic bands. In fact, in the Sun flares are observed across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. Multi-band observations of stellar flares are instead rare. This limits our ability to extend what we learn from solar flares to the case of flares occurring in stars with different properties. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: With the aim of studying flares in the 125-Myr-old stars in the Pleiades observed simultaneously in optical and X-ray light, we obtained new XMM-Newton observations of this cluster during the observations of Kepler K2 Campaign 4. The objective of this paper is to characterize the most powerful flares observed in both bands and to constrain the energy released in the optical and X-ray, the geometry of the loops, and their time evolution. We also aim to compare our results to existing studies of flares occurring in the Sun and stars at different ages. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We selected bright X-ray/optical flares that occurred in 12 known members of the Pleiades from their K2 and XMM-Newton light curves. The sample includes ten K-M stars, one F9 star, and one G8 star. Flare average properties were obtained from integrated analysis of the light curves during the flares. The time evolution of the plasma in the magnetic loops is constrained with time-resolved X-ray spectral analysis. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Most of the flares studied in this work emitted more energy in optical than in X-rays, as in most solar flares, even if the Pleiades flares output a larger fraction of their total energy in X-rays than typical solar flares do. Additionally, the energy budget in the two bands is weakly correlated. We also found comparable flare duration in optical and X-rays and observed that rapidly rotating stars (e.g., with rotation period shorter than 0.5 days) preferentially host short flares. We estimated the slope of the cooling path of the flares in the log(EM)-vs.-log(T) plane. The values we obtained are affected by large uncertainties, but their nominal values suggest that the flares analyzed in this paper are mainly due to single loops with no sustained heating occurring during the cooling phase. We also observed and analyzed oscillations with a period of 500 s during one of the flares. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The flares observed in the Pleiades can be classified as "superflares" based on their energy budget in the optical, and share some of the properties of the flares observed in the Sun, despite being more energetic. For instance, as in most solar flares, more energy is typically released in the optical than in X-rays and the duration of the flares in the two bands is correlated. We have attempted a comparison between the X-ray flares observed in the Pleiades and those observed in clusters with different ages, but to firmly address any evolutionary pattern of flare characteristics, similar and uniform multi-wavelength analyses on more complete samples are necessary.},

The final adopted ages for the groups are as follows: 149{\textasciicircum}\{+51\}\_\{-19\} \{Myr\} for the AB Dor moving group, 24 ± 3 Myr for the β Pic moving group (BPMG), 45{\textasciicircum}\{+11\}\_\{-7\} \{Myr\} for the Carina association, 42{\textasciicircum}\{+6\}\_\{-4\} \{Myr\} for the Columba association, 11 ± 3 Myr for the η Cha cluster, 45 ± 4 Myr for the Tucana-Horologium moving group (Tuc-Hor), 10 ± 3 Myr for the TW Hya association and 22{\textasciicircum}\{+4\}\_\{-3\} \{Myr\} for the 32 Ori group. At this stage we are uncomfortable assigning a final, unambiguous age to the Argus association as our membership list for the association appears to suffer from a high level of contamination, and therefore it remains unclear whether these stars represent a single population of coeval stars. Our isochronal ages for both the BPMG and Tuc-Hor are consistent with recent lithium depletion boundary (LDB) ages, which unlike isochronal ages, are relatively insensitive to the choice of low-mass evolutionary models. This consistency between the isochronal and LDB ages instils confidence that our self-consistent, absolute age scale for young, nearby moving groups is robust, and hence we suggest that these ages be adopted for future studies of these groups.

However, their relation and precise mechanisms are still unknown. We study statistically the relationship between ΔBLOS and WLE during 75 solar flares of different strengths and locations on the solar disk. We analyze SDO/HMI data and determine for each pixel in each flare if it exhibited WLE and/or ΔBLOS. We then investigate the occurrence, strength, and spatial size of the WLE, its dependence on flare energy, and its correlation to the occurrence of ΔBLOS. We detected WLE in 44/75 flares and ΔBLOS in 59/75 flares. We find that WLE and ΔBLOS are related, and their locations often overlap between 0\% and 60\%. Not all locations coincide, thus potentially indicating differences in their origin. We find that the WL area is related to the flare class by a power law, and extend the findings of previous studies, that the WLE is related to the flare class by a power law, to also be valid for C-class flares. To compare unresolved (Sun-as-a-star) WL measurements with our data, we derive a method to calculate temperatures and areas of such data under the blackbody assumption. The calculated unresolved WLE areas improve, but still differ to the resolved flaring area by about a factor of 5-10 (previously 10-20), which could be explained by various physical or instrumental causes. This method could also be applied to stellar flares to determine their temperatures and areas independently.},

A sequence of eruptions is initiated by triggering the eruption of the flux rope next to the streamer. The expansion of the rope leads to two consecutive reconnection events, each of which triggers the eruption of a flux rope by removing a sufficient amount of overlying flux. The simulation qualitatively reproduces important aspects of the global sympathetic event on 2010 August 1 and provides a scenario for the so-called twin filament eruptions.

Further, we investigate the consequences of flare sympathy for a specific model of flare statistics, the M. S. Wheatland and I. J. D. Craig (Astrophys. J. 595, 458, 2003) model. The original treatment describes an assembly of reconnecting structures (labelled separators) that flare independently according to simple rules consistent with magnetohydrodynamic flare models. This description is modified by allowing a flare at one separator to increase the probability of flaring at all other separators for a period of time following the flare, by an amount proportional to the energy of the flare. Simulations illustrate the transition of the model from weak to strong sympathy. In the limit of weak sympathy, the model reproduces observed flare frequency energy and waiting-time distributions.},

	abstract = {The Fermi paradox is the conflict between an expectation of a high \{{\textbackslash}em ex ante\} probability of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe and the apparently lifeless universe we in fact observe. The expectation that the universe should be teeming with intelligent life is linked to models like the Drake equation, which suggest that even if the probability of intelligent life developing at a given site is small, the sheer multitude of possible sites should nonetheless yield a large number of potentially observable civilizations. We show that this conflict arises from the use of Drake-like equations, which implicitly assume certainty regarding highly uncertain parameters. We examine these parameters, incorporating models of chemical and genetic transitions on paths to the origin of life, and show that extant scientific knowledge corresponds to uncertainties that span multiple orders of magnitude. This makes a stark difference. When the model is recast to represent realistic distributions of uncertainty, we find a substantial \{{\textbackslash}em ex ante\} probability of there being no other intelligent life in our observable universe, and thus that there should be little surprise when we fail to detect any signs of it. This result dissolves the Fermi paradox, and in doing so removes any need to invoke speculative mechanisms by which civilizations would inevitably fail to have observable effects upon the universe.},

We collect the arguments for and against technosignatures’ ubiquity and discuss the implications of some properties of technological life that fundamentally differ from nontechnological life in the context of modern astrobiology: It can spread among the stars to many sites, it can be more easily detected at large distances, and it can produce signs that are unambiguously technological. As an illustration in terms of the Drake equation, we consider two Drake-like equations, for technosignatures (calculating N(tech)) and biosignatures (calculating N(bio)). We argue that Earth and humanity may be poor guides to the longevity term L and that its maximum value could be very large, in that technology can outlive its creators and even its host star. We conclude that while the Drake equation implies that N(bio) ≫ N(tech), it is also plausible that N(tech) ≫ N(bio). As a consequence, as we seek possible indicators of extraterrestrial life, for instance, via characterization of the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets, we should search for both biosignatures and technosignatures. This exercise also illustrates ways in which biosignature and technosignature searches can complement and supplement each other and how methods of technosignature search, including old ideas from SETI, can inform the search for biosignatures and life generally.},

	abstract = {We seek to model the coupled evolution of a civilization and its host planet through the era when energy harvesting by the civilization drives the planet into new and adverse climate states. In this way, we ask if triggering “Anthropocenes” of the kind humanity is experiencing might be a generic feature of planet−civilization evolution. This question has direct consequences for both the study of astrobiology and the sustainability of human civilization. Furthermore, if Anthropocenes prove fatal for some civilizations then they can be considered as one form of a “Great Filter” and are therefore relevant to discussions of the Fermi Paradox. In this study, we focus on the effects of energy harvesting via combustion and vary the planet's initial chemistry and orbital radius. We find that in this context, the most influential parameter dictating a civilization's fate is their host planet’s climate sensitivity, which quantifies how global temperatures change as CO2 is added to the atmosphere. Furthermore, this is in itself a function of the planet's atmospheric CO2 level, so planets with low levels of CO2 will have high climate sensitivities and high probabilities of triggering climate change. Using simulations of the coupled nonlinear model combined with semi-analytic treatments, we find that most planets in our initial parameter space experience diminished growth due to climate effects, an event we call a “climate-dominated Anthropocene.”},

Here, we broaden the idea of intelligence as a collective property and extend it to the planetary scale. We consider the ways in which the appearance of technological intelligence may represent a kind of planetary scale transition, and thus might be seen not as something which happens on a planet but to a planet, much as some models propose the origin of life itself was a planetary phenomenon. Our approach follows the recognition among researchers that the correct scale to understand key aspects of life and its evolution is planetary, as opposed to the more traditional focus on individual species. We explore ways in which the concept may prove useful for three distinct domains: Earth Systems and Exoplanet studies; Anthropocene and Sustainability studies; and the study of Technosignatures and the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). We argue that explorations of planetary intelligence, defined as the acquisition and application of collective knowledge operating at a planetary scale and integrated into the function of coupled planetary systems, can prove a useful framework for understanding possible paths of the long-term evolution of inhabited planets including future trajectories for life on Earth and predicting features of intelligentially steered planetary evolution on other worlds.},

	abstract = {GJ436b might be the prototype of warm Neptunes that have undergone late migration induced by an outer companion. Precise determination of the orbital architecture of such systems is critical to constraining their dynamical history and evaluating the role of delayed migration in the exoplanet population. To this purpose we analyzed the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) signal of GJ436 b in two transits - recently observed with ESPRESSO - using three different techniques. The high level of precision achieved in radial velocity (RV) measurements allows us to detect the deviation from the Keplerian orbit, despite the slow rotation of the M dwarf host (vsini = 272.0+40.0-34.0 m/s), and to measure the sky-projected obliquity (\${\textbackslash}lambda\$ = 102.5+17.2-18.5\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$). The Reloaded RM technique, which allows the stellar RV field along the transit chord to be analyzed, yields \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ = 107.5+23.6-19.3\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and vsini = 292.9+41.9-49.9 m/s. The RM Revolutions technique, which allows us to fit the spectral profiles from all planet-occulted regions together, yields \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ = 114.1+22.8-17.8\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and vsini = 300.5+45.9-57.0 m/s. The consistent results between these three techniques, and with published results from HARPS/HARPS-N data, confirm the polar orbit of GJ436b and support the hypothesis that its origin lies in Kozai migration. Results from a joint RM Revolutions analysis of the ESPRESSO, HARPS, and HARPS-N datasets (\${\textbackslash}lambda\$ = 113.5+23.3-17.3\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$; vsini = 293.5+43.7-52.2 m/s) combined with a revised stellar inclination (\$i\_{\textbackslash}star\$ = 35.7+5.9-7.6\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ or 144.2+7.6-5.9\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$) lead us to constrain the 3D obliquity \${\textbackslash}Psi\$ to 103.2+12.8-11.5\${\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of the first bona-fide brown dwarfs and extra-solar planets in 1995, the field of low-mass stars and substellar objects has progressed considerably, both from theoretical and observational viewpoints. Recent developments in the physics entering the modeling of these objects have led to significant improvements in the theory and to a better understanding of these objects' mechanical and thermal properties. This theory can now be confronted with observations directly in various observational diagrams (color-color, color-magnitude, mass-magnitude, mass-spectral type), a stringent and unavoidable constraint that became possible only recently with the generation of synthetic spectra. In this paper we present the current state-of-the-art general theory of low-mass stars and sub stellar objects, from one solar mass to one Jupiter mass, regarding primarily their interior structure and evolution. This review is a natural complement to the previous review by Allard et al (1997) on the atmosphere of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Special attention is devoted to the comparison of the theory with various available observations. The contribution of low-mass stellar and sub stellar objects to the Galactic mass budget is also analyzed.},

Photometric data from Kepler/K2 has allowed similar studies to be carried out on other stars. Here, we utilize Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometric 2-min cadence of 167 low-mass stars from Sectors 1 to 3 to investigate the relationship between star-spots and stellar flares. From our sample, 90 per cent show clear rotational modulation likely due to the presence of a large, dominant star-spot and we use this to determine a rotational period for each star. Additionally, each low-mass star shows one or more flares in its light curve and using Gaia Data Release 2 parallaxes and SkyMapper magnitudes we can estimate the energy of the flares in the TESS band-pass. Overall, we have 1834 flares from the 167 low-mass stars with energies from 6.0 × 1029 to 2.4 × 1035 erg. We find none of the stars in our sample show any preference for rotational phase, suggesting the lack of a correlation between the large, dominant star-spot, and flare number. We discuss this finding in greater detail and present further scenarios to account for the origin of flares on these low-mass stars.},

Although the mechanisms by which fully convective stars generate large-scale magnetic fields are not well understood, it is clear that, as for solar-type stars, stellar rotation plays a pivotal role. We present 270 new optical spectra of low-mass stars in the Solar Neighborhood. Combining our observations with those from the literature, our sample comprises 2202 measurements or non-detections of Hα emission in nearby M dwarfs. This includes 466 with photometric rotation periods. Stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.6 M⊙ are well-represented in our sample, with fast and slow rotators of all masses. We observe a threshold in the mass-period plane that separates active and inactive M dwarfs. The threshold coincides with the fast-period edge of the slowly rotating population, at approximately the rotation period at which an era of rapid rotational evolution appears to cease. The well-defined active/inactive boundary indicates that Hα activity is a useful diagnostic for stellar rotation period, e.g., for target selection for exoplanet surveys, and we present a mass-period relation for inactive M dwarfs. We also find a significant, moderate correlation between LHα/Lbol and variability amplitude: more active stars display higher levels of photometric variability. Consistent with previous work, our data show that rapid rotators maintain a saturated value of LHα/Lbol. Our data also show a clear power-law decay in LHα/Lbol with Rossby number for slow rotators, with an index of -1.7 ± 0.1.},

Using infrared and optical spectra, we confirm that SDSSJ0221 is a relatively nearby (d {\textasciitilde} 76 pc) M8 dwarf with strong quiescent Hα emission. Based on kinematics and the absence of features consistent with low-gravity (young) ultracool dwarfs, we place a lower limit of 200 Myr on the age of SDSSJ0221.

We measure the area fractal dimension D2, also called the Hausdorff dimension, with a box-counting method, which describes the fractal area as A(L) {\textasciitilde} LD2. We apply the fractal analysis to a statistical sample of 20 GOES X- and M-class flares, including the Bastille Day 2000 July 14 flare, one of the largest flares ever recorded. We find that the fractal area (normalized by the time-integrated flare area Af) varies from near zero at the beginning of the flare to a maximum of A(t)/Af = 0.65 +/- 0.12 after the peak time of the flare, which corresponds to an area fractal dimension in the range of 1.0lesssim D2(t) lesssim 1.89 +/- 0.05. We find that the total EUV flux Ftot(t) is linearly correlated with the fractal area A(t) . From the area fractal dimension D2, the volume fractal dimension D3 can be inferred (subject of Paper II), which is crucial to inferring a realistic volume filling factor, which affects the derived electron densities, thermal energies, and cooling times of solar and stellar flares.},

	abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large data sets. Gaussian processes (GPs) are a popular class of models used for this purpose, but since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small data sets. In this paper, we present a novel method for GPs modeling in one dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the data set. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series data sets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically driven damped harmonic oscillators—providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice—but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable GP methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

Simultaneous Near-ultraviolet (NUV, 1750-2800 Å) and Far-ultraviolet (FUV, 1350-1750 Å) time-tagged photometry with time resolution better than 0.1 s shows that the overall brightness in the FUV band increased by a factor of 1000 in 200 s. Under the assumption that the NUV emission is mostly due to a stellar continuum, and that the FUV flux is shared equally between emission lines and continuum, there is evidence for two distinct flare components for this event. The first flare type is characterized by an exponential increase in flux with little or no increase in temperature. The other involves rapid increases in both temperature and flux. While the decay time for the first flare component may be several hours, the second flare event decayed over less than 1 minute, suggesting that there was little or no confinement of the heated plasma.},

While the coronal properties of flares are studied best in X-rays, the chromosphere of the star is observed best in the optical and ultraviolet ranges. Therefore, multiwavelength observations are essential to study flare properties throughout the atmosphere of a star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: We analysed simultaneous observations with UVES/VLT and XMM-Newton of the active M5.5 dwarf CN Leo (Gl 406) exhibiting a major flare. The optical data cover the wavelength range from 3000 to 10 000 Å. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: From our optical data, we find an enormous wealth of chromospheric emission lines occurring throughout the spectrum. We identify a total of 1143 emission lines, out of which 154 are located in the red arm, increasing the number of observed emission lines in this red wavelength range by about a factor of 10. Here we present an emission line list and a spectral atlas. We also find line asymmetries for H I, He I, and Ca II lines. For the last, this is the first observation of asymmetries due to a stellar flare. During the flare onset, there is additional flux found in the blue wing, while in the decay phase, additional flux is found in the red wing. We interpret both features as caused by mass motions. In addition to the lines, the flare manifests itself in the enhancement of the continuum throughout the whole spectrum, inverting the normal slope for the net flare spectrum. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile, 077.D-0011(A) and on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and NASA.

	abstract = {The Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) instrument includes a “white light” imaging capability with novel characteristics. Many flares with such white-light emission have been detected, and this paper provides an introductory overview of these data. These observations have 0.5″ pixel size and use the full broad-band response of the CCD sensor; the images are not compromised by ground-based seeing and have excellent pointing stability as well as high time resolution. The spectral response of the TRACE white-light passband extends into the UV, so these data capture, for the first time in images, the main radiative energy of a flare. This initial survey is based on a sample of flares observed at high time resolution for which the Reuven Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) had complete data coverage, a total of 11 events up to the end of 2004. We characterize these events in terms of source morphology and contrast against the photosphere. We confirm the strong association of the TRACE white-light emissions - which include UV as well as visual wavelengths with hard X-ray sources observed by RHESSI. The images show fine structure at the TRACE resolution limit, and often show this fine structure to be extended over large areas rather than just in simple footpoint sources. The white-light emission shows strong intermittency both in space and in time and commonly contains features unresolved at the TRACE resolution. We detect white-light continuum emission in flares as weak as GOES C1.6. limited by photon statistics and background solar fluctuations, and support the conclusion of Neidig (1989) that white-light continuum occurs in essentially all flares.},

We obtain high-resolution optical spectra for 206 targets and determine projected rotational velocity, vsin i, and Hα emission. The data are combined with measurements of vsin i in field stars of the same spectral type from the literature. Our sample adds 157 new rotation measurements to the existing literature and almost doubles the sample of available vsin i. The final sample provides a statistically meaningful picture of rotation and activity at the transition to full convection in the solar neighborhood. We confirm a steep rise in the fraction of active stars at the transition to full convection known from earlier work. In addition, we see a clear rise in rotational velocity in the same stars. In very few stars, no chromospheric activity but a detection of rotational broadening is reported. We argue that all of them are probably spurious detections; we conclude that in our sample all significantly rotating stars are active, and all active stars are significantly rotating. The rotation-activity relation is valid in partially and in fully convective stars. Thus, we do not observe any evidence for a transition from a rotationally dominated dynamo in partially convective stars to a rotation-independent turbulent dynamo in fully convective stars; turbulent dynamos in fully convective stars of spectral types around M4 are still driven by rotation. Finally, we compare projected rotational velocities of 33 stars to rotational periods derived from photometry in the literature and determine inclinations for a few of them.},

In this paper, we present the survey sample by publishing one CARMENES spectrum for each M dwarf. These spectra cover the wavelength range 520-1710 nm at a resolution of at least R \&gt;80 000, and we measure its RV, Hα emission, and projected rotation velocity. We present an atlas of high-resolution M-dwarf spectra and compare the spectra to atmospheric models. To quantify the RV precision that can be achieved in low-mass stars over the CARMENES wavelength range, we analyze our empirical information on the RV precision from more than 6500 observations. We compare our high-resolution M-dwarf spectra to atmospheric models where we determine the spectroscopic RV information content, Q, and signal-to-noise ratio. We find that for all M-type dwarfs, the highest RV precision can be reached in the wavelength range 700-900 nm. Observations at longer wavelengths are equally precise only at the very latest spectral types (M8 and M9). We demonstrate that in this spectroscopic range, the large amount of absorption features compensates for the intrinsic faintness of an M7 star. To reach an RV precision of 1 m s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} in very low mass M dwarfs at longer wavelengths likely requires the use of a 10 m class telescope. For spectral types M6 and earlier, the combination of a red visual and a near-infrared spectrograph is ideal to search for low-mass planets and to distinguish between planets and stellar variability. At a 4 m class telescope, an instrument like CARMENES has the potential to push the RV precision well below the typical jitter level of 3-4 m s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}.},

	abstract = {Main-sequence, fully convective M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries are observed to be larger than stellar evolutionary models predict by as much as 10\%-15\%. A proposed explanation for this discrepancy involves effects from strong magnetic fields, induced by rapid rotation via the dynamo process. Although, a handful of single, slowly rotating M dwarfs with radius measurements from interferometry also appear to be larger than models predict, suggesting that rotation or binarity specifically may not be the sole cause of the discrepancy. We test whether single, rapidly rotating, fully convective stars are also larger than expected by measuring their R{\textbackslash}sin i distribution. We combine photometric rotation periods from the literature with rotational broadening (v{\textbackslash}sin i) measurements reported in this work for a sample of 88 rapidly rotating M dwarf stars. Using a Bayesian framework, we find that stellar evolutionary models underestimate the radii by 10 \% \{--\}15\{ \% \}-2.5+3, but that at higher masses (0.18 {\textless} M {\textless} 0.4 M Sun), the discrepancy is only about 6\% and comparable to results from interferometry and eclipsing binaries. At the lowest masses (0.08 {\textless} M {\textless} 0.18 M Sun), we find that the discrepancy between observations and theory is 13\%-18\%, and we argue that the discrepancy is unlikely to be due to effects from age. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant radius discrepancy between our sample and the handful of M dwarfs with interferometric radii. We conclude that neither rotation nor binarity are responsible for the inflated radii of fully convective M dwarfs, and that all fully convective M dwarfs are larger than models predict.},

To derive the radial and rotational velocities of the two stars as well as their relative metallicity with respect to Proxima, we also present new individual UVES high-resolution spectra of the two components. Placing GJ65 A and B in the mass-radius diagram shows that their radii exceed expectations from recent models by 14 ± 4\% and 12 ± 4\%, respectively. Following previous theories, we propose that this discrepancy is caused by the inhibition of convective energy transport by a strong internal magnetic field generated by dynamo effect in these two fast-rotating stars. A comparison with the almost identical twin Proxima, which is rotating slowly, strengthens this hypothesis because the radius of Proxima does not appear to be inflated compared to models. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO programmes 076.B-0055(A), 173.C-0606(B), 079.C-0216(A), 082.C-0518(C), 086.C-0515(A), 087.D-0150(B) and 091.D-0074(A).},

	abstract = {For the vast majority of stars in the second Gaia data release, reliable distances cannot be obtained by inverting the parallax. A correct inference procedure must instead be used to account for the nonlinearity of the transformation and the asymmetry of the resulting probability distribution. Here, we infer distances to essentially all 1.33 billion stars with parallaxes published in the second Gaia data release. This is done using a weak distance prior that varies smoothly as a function of Galactic longitude and latitude according to a Galaxy model. The irreducible uncertainty in the distance estimate is characterized by the lower and upper bounds of an asymmetric confidence interval. Although more precise distances can be estimated for a subset of the stars using additional data (such as photometry), our goal is to provide purely geometric distance estimates, independent of assumptions about the physical properties of, or interstellar extinction toward, individual stars. We analyze the characteristics of the catalog and validate it using clusters. The catalog can be queried using ADQL at http://gaia.ari.uni-heidelberg.de/tap.html (which also hosts the Gaia catalog) and downloaded from http://www.mpia.de/{\textasciitilde}calj/gdr2\_distances.html.},

We use this list, along with the lists of confirmed WISE-based motion objects from the recent papers by Luhman and by Schneider et al., and candidate motion objects from the recent paper by Gagné et al., to search for widely separated, common-proper-motion systems.

Highlights include: (1) the identification of three G/K dwarfs that can be used as standard candles to study clumpiness and grain size in nearby molecular clouds because these objects are currently moving behind the clouds, (2) the confirmation/discovery of several M, L, and T dwarfs and one white dwarf whose spectrophotometric distance estimates place them 5-20 pc from the Sun, (3) the suggestion that the Na I “D” line be used as a diagnostic tool for interpreting and classifying metal-poor late-M and L dwarfs, (4) the recognition of a triple system including a carbon dwarf and late-M subdwarf, for which model fits of the late-M subdwarf (giving [Fe/H] ≈ -1.0) provide a measured metallicity for the carbon star, and (5) a possible 24 pc distant K5 dwarf + peculiar red L5 system with an apparent physical separation of 0.1 pc.},

We also report observations for 13 of the 17 known Tuc-Hor members in this spectral type range, and that 62 additional candidates are likely to be unassociated field stars; the confirmation frequency for new candidates is therefore 129/191 = 67\%. We have used radial velocities, Hα emission, and Li6708 absorption to distinguish between contaminants and bona fide members. Our expanded census of Tuc-Hor increases the known population by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3 in total and by a factor of {\textasciitilde}8 for members with SpT {\textgreater}= K3, but even so, the K-M dwarf population of Tuc-Hor is still markedly incomplete. Our expanded census allows for a much more detailed study of Tuc-Hor than was previously feasible. The spatial distribution of members appears to trace a two-dimensional sheet, with a broad distribution in X and Y, but a very narrow distribution (±5 pc) in Z. The corresponding velocity distribution is very small, with a scatter of ±1.1 km s-1 about the mean UVW velocity for stars spanning the entire 50 pc extent of Tuc-Hor. We also show that the isochronal age (τ {\textasciitilde} 20-30 Myr) and the lithium depletion boundary age (τ {\textasciitilde} 40 Myr) disagree, following the trend in other pre-main-sequence populations for isochrones to yield systematically younger ages. The Hα emission line strength follows a trend of increasing equivalent width with later spectral type, as is seen for young clusters. We find that moving group members have been depleted of measurable lithium for spectral types of K7.0-M4.5. None of our targets have significant infrared excesses in the WISE W3 band, yielding an upper limit on warm debris disks of F {\textless} 0.7\%. Finally, our purely kinematic and color-magnitude selection procedure allows us to test the efficiency and completeness for activity-based selection of young stars. We find that 60\% of K-M dwarfs in Tuc-Hor do not have ROSAT counterparts and would have been omitted in X-ray-selected samples. In contrast, GALEX UV-selected samples using a previously suggested criterion for youth achieve completeness of 77\% and purity of 78\%, and we suggest new SpT-dependent selection criteria that will yield {\textgreater}95\% completeness for τ {\textasciitilde} 40 Myr populations with GALEX data available.},

	abstract = {Context. Full-disk solar flux spectra can be directly compared to stellar spectra and thereby serve as our most important reference source for, for example stellar chemical abundances, magnetic activity phenomena, radial-velocity signatures or global pulsations. Aim. As part of the first Potsdam Echelle Polarimetric and Spectroscopic Instrument (PEPSI) key-science project, we aim to provide well-exposed and average-combined (viz. deep) high-resolution spectra of representative stellar targets. Such deep spectra contain an overwhelming amount of information, typically much more than what could be analyzed and discussed within a single publication. Therefore, these spectra will be made available in form of (electronic) atlases. The first star in this series of papers is our Sun. It also acts as a system-performance cornerstone. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The Sun was monitored with PEPSI at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). Instead of the LBT we used a small robotic solar disk integration (SDI) telescope. The deep spectra in this paper are the results of combining up to ≈100 consecutive exposures per wavelength setting and are compared with other solar flux atlases. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Our software for the optimal data extraction and reduction of PEPSI spectra is described and verified with the solar data. Three deep solar flux spectra with a spectral resolution of up to 270 000, a continuous wavelength coverage from 383 nm to 914 nm, and a photon signal to noise ratio (S/N) of between 2000-8000:1 depending on wavelength are presented. Additionally, a time-series of 996 high-cadence spectra in one cross disperser is used to search for intrinsic solar modulations. The wavelength calibration based on Th-Ar exposures and simultaneous Fabry-Pérot combs enables an absolute wavelength solution within 10 m s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} (rms) with respect to the HARPS laser-comb solar atlas and a relative rms of 1.2 m s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for one day. For science demonstration, we redetermined the disk-average solar Li abundance to 1.09 ± 0.04 dex on the basis of 3D NLTE model atmospheres. We detected disk-averaged p-mode RV oscillations with a full amplitude of 47 cm s{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} at 5.5 min. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Comparisons with two solar FTS atlases, as well as with the HARPS solar atlas, validate the PEPSI data product.

This paper does not introduce a new detection technique, but instead studies the reliability and efficiency of detection with the most commonly used technique, the periodogram, in the case where the observation times are unevenly spaced. This choice was made because, of the methods in current use, it appears to have the simplest statistical behavior. A modification of the classical definition of the periodogram is necessary in order to retain the simple statistical behavior of the evenly spaced case. With this modification, periodogram analysis and least-squares fitting of sine waves to the data are exactly equivalent. Certain difficulties with the use of the periodogram are less important than commonly believed in the case of detection of strictly periodic signals. In addition, the standard method for mitigating these difficulties (tapering) can be used just as well if the sampling is uneven. An analysis of the statistical significance of signal detections is presented, with examples},

In addition, we study magnetic activity as a function of position on the color-magnitude diagram, finding that Hα magnetically active stars have, on average, redder colors and/or brighter magnitudes than inactive stars. This effect cannot be explained by youth alone and might indicate that active stars are magnetically inflated, binaries, and/or high metallicity. Moreover, we find that vertical velocity and vertical action dispersion are correlated with Hα emission, confirming that these two parameters are age indicators.

We find seven stars that show evidence of QPPs. Using Fourier and empirical mode decomposition techniques, we confirm the presence of 11 QPPs in these seven stars with a period between 10.2 and 71.9 minutes, including an oscillation with strong drift in the period and a double-mode oscillation. The fraction of flares that showed QPPs (7\%) is higher than other studies of stellar flares, but it is very similar to the fraction of solar C-class flares. Based on the stellar parameters taken from the TESS Input Catalog, we determine the lengths and magnetic-field strengths of the flare coronal loops using the period of the QPPs and various assumptions about the origin of the QPPs. We also use a scaling relationship based on flares from the Sun and solar-type stars and the observed energy, plus the duration of the flares, finding that the different approaches predict loop lengths that are consistent to within a factor of about two. We also discuss the flare frequency of the seven stars determining whether this could result in ozone depletion or abiogenesis in any orbiting exoplanet. Three of our stars have a sufficiently high rate of energetic flares, which are likely to cause abiogenesis. However, two of these stars are also in the range where ozone depletion is likely to occur. We speculate on the implications of the flare rates, loop lengths, and QPPs for life on potential exoplanets orbiting in their host star's habitable zone.},

After a brief historical overview, the review is divided into two separate but not independent parts: the first illustrates the observational framework, the second reviews the theoretical knowledge. Quiescent loops and their confined plasma are considered and, therefore, topics such as loop oscillations and flaring loops (except for non-solar ones, which provide information on stellar loops) are not specifically addressed here. The observational section discusses the classification, populations, and the morphology of coronal loops, its relationship with the magnetic field, and the loop stranded structure. The section continues with the thermal properties and diagnostics of the loop plasma, according to the classification into hot, warm, and cool loops. Then, temporal analyses of loops and the observations of plasma dynamics, hot and cool flows, and waves are illustrated. In the modeling section, some basics of loop physics are provided, supplying fundamental scaling laws and timescales, a useful tool for consultation. The concept of loop modeling is introduced and models are divided into those treating loops as monolithic and static, and those resolving loops into thin and dynamic strands. More specific discussions address modeling the loop fine structure and the plasma flowing along the loops. Special attention is devoted to the question of loop heating, with separate discussion of wave (AC) and impulsive (DC) heating. Large-scale models including atmosphere boxes and the magnetic field are also discussed. Finally, a brief discussion about stellar coronal loops is followed by highlights and open questions.},

	abstract = {Getman et al. report the discovery, energetics, frequencies, and effects on environs of {\textgreater}1000 X-ray superflares with X-ray energies EX {\textasciitilde} 1034-1038 erg from pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars identified in the Chandra MYStIX and SFiNCs surveys. Here we perform detailed plasma evolution modeling of 55 bright MYStIX/SFiNCs superflares from these events. They constitute a large sample of the most powerful stellar flares analyzed in a uniform fashion. They are compared with published X-ray superflares from young stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster, older active stars, and the Sun. Several results emerge. First, the properties of PMS X-ray superflares are independent of the presence or absence of protoplanetary disks inferred from infrared photometry, supporting the solar-type model of PMS flaring magnetic loops with both footpoints anchored in the stellar surface. Second, most PMS superflares resemble solar long-duration events that are associated with coronal mass ejections. Slow-rise PMS superflares are an interesting exception. Third, strong correlations of superflare peak emission measure and plasma temperature with the stellar mass are similar to established correlations for the PMS X-ray emission composed of numerous smaller flares. Fourth, a new correlation of loop geometry is linked to stellar mass; more massive stars appear to have thicker flaring loops. Finally, the slope of a long-standing relationship between the X-ray luminosity and magnetic flux of various solar-stellar magnetic elements appears steeper in PMS superflares than for solar events.},

Such space weather events may have important ramifications for the habitability and observational fingerprints of exoplanetary atmospheres. Here, using a suite of three-dimensional coupled chemistry-climate model simulations, we explore effects of time-dependent stellar activity on rocky planet atmospheres orbiting G, K and M dwarf stars. We employ observed data from the MUSCLES campaign and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and test a range of rotation period, magnetic field strength and flare frequency assumptions. We find that recurring flares drive the atmospheres of planets around K and M dwarfs into chemical equilibria that substantially deviate from their pre-flare regimes, whereas the atmospheres of G dwarf planets quickly return to their baseline states. Interestingly, simulated O2-poor and O2-rich atmospheres experiencing flares produce similar mesospheric nitric oxide abundances, suggesting that stellar flares can highlight otherwise undetectable chemical species. Applying a radiative transfer model to our chemistry-climate model results, we find that flare-driven transmission features of bio-indicating chemical species, such as nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide and nitric acid, show particular promise for detection by future instruments.},

	abstract = {Stellar flares are a frequent occurrence on young low-mass stars around which many detected exoplanets orbit. Flares are energetic, impulsive events, and their impact on exoplanetary atmospheres needs to be taken into account when interpreting transit observations. We have developed a model to describe the upper atmosphere of extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) orbiting flaring stars. The model simulates thermal escape from the upper atmospheres of close-in EGPs. Ionisation by solar radiation and electron impact is included and photo-chemical and diffusive transport processes are simulated. This model is used to study the effect of stellar flares from the solar-like G star {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}HD 209458{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} and the young K star {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}HD 189733{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} on their respective planets, {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}HD 209458b{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} and {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}HD 189733b{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}. The {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Sun{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} is used as a proxy for HD 209458, and {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}ɛ Eridani{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater}, as a proxy for HD 189733. A hypothetical HD 209458b-like planet orbiting the very active M star {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}AU Microscopii{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} is also simulated. We find that the neutral upper atmosphere of EGPs is not significantly affected by typical flares on HD 209458 and HD 189733. Therefore, stellar flares alone would not cause large enough changes in planetary mass loss to explain the variations in HD 189733b transit depth seen in previous studies, although we show that it may be possible that an extreme stellar proton event could result in the required mass loss. Our simulations do however reveal an enhancement in electron number density in the ionosphere of these planets, the peak of which is located in the layer where stellar X-rays are absorbed. Electron densities are found to reach 2.2 to 3.5 times pre-flare levels and enhanced electron densities last from about 3 to 10 h after the onset of the flare, depending on the composition of the ionospheric layer. The strength of the flare and the width of its spectral energy distribution affect the range of altitudes in the ionosphere that see enhancements in ionisation. A large broadband continuum component in the XUV portion of the flaring spectrum in very young flare stars, such as AU Mic, results in a broad range of altitudes affected in planets orbiting this star. Indeed, as well as the X-ray absorption layer, the layer in which EUV photons are absorbed is also strongly enhanced.},

	abstract = {The close binary Algol system contains a radio-bright KIV subgiant star in a very close (0.062 astronomical units) and rapid (2.86 day) orbit with a main sequence B8 star. Because the rotation periods of the two stars are tidally locked to the orbital period, the rapid rotation drives a magnetic dynamo. A large body of evidence points to the existence of an extended, complex coronal magnetosphere originating at the cooler K subgiant. The detailed morphology of the subgiant's corona and its possible interaction with its companion are unknown, though theory predicts that the coronal plasma should be confined in a magnetic loop structure, as seen on the Sun. Here we report multi-epoch radio imaging of the Algol system, in which we see a large, persistent coronal loop approximately one subgiant diameter in height, whose base is straddling the subgiant and whose apex is oriented towards the B8 star. This suggests that a persistent asymmetric magnetic field structure is aligned between the two stars. The loop is larger than anticipated theoretically, but the size may be the result of a magnetic interaction between the two stars.},

	abstract = {The ASCA satellite has recently detected variable hard X-ray emission from two class I protostars in the ρ Oph cloud, YLW 15 (IRS 43) and WL 6, with a characteristic timescale of {\textasciitilde}20 hr. In YLW 15, the X-ray emission is in the form of quasi-periodic energetic flares, which we explain in terms of strong magnetic shearing and reconnection between the central star and the accretion disk. The flare modeling, based on the solar analogy, gives us access to the size of the magnetic structures, which in turn allows us to calculate the rotation parameters of the star and the disk. In WL 6, X-ray flaring is rotationally modulated and appears to be more like the solar-type magnetic activity ubiquitous on T Tauri stars. On the basis of these observations, we find that YLW 15 is a fast rotator (near break-up), while WL 6 rotates with a significantly longer period. We thus use X-ray flaring as a ``clock'' to measure the rotation of protostars. With the help of the mass-radius relation on the stellar ``birthline,'' we derive masses of M*{\textasciitilde}2 Msolar and {\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.4 Msolar for the central stars of YLW 15 and WL 6, respectively. YLW 15 thus appears to be a future A star. In the long term, the magnetic interactions between the star and the disk result in magnetic braking and angular momentum loss of the star. A comparison of the rotation behavior of YLW 15 and WL 6 confirms that for solar-mass stars magnetic braking takes place on timescales tbr{\textasciitilde}a fewx105 yr, i.e., of the same order as the estimated duration of the class I protostar stage. The main parameter determining tbr turns out to be the stellar mass, so that close to the birthline there must be a mass-rotation relation, tbr{\textasciitilde}{\textasciitilde}M*, such that stars with M*{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1-2 Msolar are fast rotators, while their lower mass counterparts have had the time to spin down and reach synchronous rotation with the inner surrounding accretion disk. The rapid rotation and strong star-disk magnetic interactions of YLW 15 also naturally explain the observation of ``superflares'' of X-ray luminosities as high as LX{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1033-1034 ergs s-1 during a few hours, while at the WL 6 stage the lower X-ray luminosities are likely to be of purely stellar origin. The mass-rotation relation through magnetic braking may also explain why so few class I protostars have been detected in X-rays to date, and why they all lie in clusters. In the case of YLW 15, and perhaps also in other protostars, a hot coronal wind (T{\textasciitilde}106 K) may be responsible for the VLA thermal radio emission. This paper thus proposes the first clues to the magnetic properties of protostars, which govern their rotation status and evolution.},

We also present new observations of GJ 791.2A (M4.5V, Prot = 0.31 d). Observations of each star were made on two nights with UVES, covering a wavelength range from 0.64 - 1.03μm. The time series spectra reveal multiple line distortions that we interpret as cool star-spots and which are persistent on both nights suggesting stability on the time-scale of 3 d. Spots are recovered with resolutions down to 8.3° at the equator. The global spot distributions for GJ 791.2A are similar to observations made a year earlier. Similar high latitude and circumpolar spot structure is seen on GJ 791.2A and GJ 65A. However, they are surprisingly absent on GJ 65B, which instead reveals more extensive, larger, spots concentrated at intermediate latitudes. All three stars show small amplitude latitude-dependent rotation that is consistent with solid body rotation. We compare our measurements of differential rotation with previous Doppler imaging studies and discuss the results in the wider context of other observational estimates and recent theoretical predictions.},

We present the first high resolution Doppler images of the M4.5 dwarf, GJ 791.2A, and the M9 dwarf, LP 944-20. The time series spectra of both objects reveal numerous line profile distortions over the rotation period of each star, which we interpret as starspots. The transient distortions are modeled with spot/photosphere contrast ratios that correspond to model atmosphere temperature differences of \{T\}\{phot\}-\{T\}\{spot\} = 300 and 200 K. GJ 791.2A is a fully convective star with v sin i = 35.1 km s-1. Although we find more starspot structure at high latitudes, we reconstruct spots at a range of phases and latitudes with a mean spot filling of ∼3\%. LP 944-20 is one of the brightest known late-M dwarfs, with spectral type M9V and v sin i = 30.8 km s-1. Its spectral time series exhibits two dominant transient line distortions that are reconstructed as high latitude spots, while a mean spot filling factor of only 1.5\% is found. The occurrence of low-contrast spots at predominantly high latitudes, which we see in both targets here, is, in general, likely to be responsible for the low amplitude photometric variability seen in late-M dwarfs. For GJ 791.2A, the radial velocities induced by the starspot features yield an rms velocity variability of 138 m s-1, which can be reduced by a factor of 1.9 using our reconstructed surface brightness distributions.},

	abstract = {We present spectropolarimetric observations of the young, single early G-dwarf HD 171488. These observations were obtained over a five-night period in 2004 September at the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope using the SEMPOL spectropolarimeter visitor instrument. Using the technique of least-squares deconvolution to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the data, we have applied Zeeman Doppler imaging to reconstruct brightness and magnetic surface topologies of the star. The brightness image shows a large polar spot with weaker low- to mid-latitude features, confirming an earlier Doppler imaging observation. The reconstruction of the surface magnetic field shows regions of radial field at all latitudes (except near the pole) and regions of azimuthal field predominantly at high latitudes (60°-70°), with the azimuthal field almost forming a ring around the polar regions. We have incorporated a solar-like differential rotation law into the imaging process to determine the surface differential rotation of cool spots on HD 171488. This gives an equatorial rotation rate of 1.313 +/- 0.004 d and a surface shear of dΩ = 0.402 +/- 0.044 radd-1. This means that the equator of HD 171488 laps the poles every {\textasciitilde}16 +/- 2 d and that HD 171488 has a photospheric shear approximately seven times the solar value. This is the largest measurement of surface differential rotation yet obtained using the Doppler imaging method and is over twice the value of previously observed early G-dwarfs.},

EK Dra is an important target for investigating the evolution of stellar magnetism because it resembles the rapidly-rotating young Sun. From the inversion of a total of 12 spectral lines we reconstruct several cool spots at low and medium latitudes but the dominating feature is located consistently at a latitude of {\textasciitilde}70-80° , thus, at far higher latitudes than where our Sun shows spots. In fact, our data indicate that this feature could be an appendage of a larger polar cap-like spot as seen on other rapidly-rotating stars, however, due to the small vsin i of just 17.3+/-0.4 kms(-1) {\textbackslash} the cap's existence remains inconclusive. Spot temperatures between Delta T{\textasciitilde}1200 K and 400 K are recovered. We have used the non-parametrized convective-flux description of Canuto \&amp; Mazzitelli for our input model atmospheres and found good agreement with local line profiles computed from standard mixing-length atmospheres. New phase-resolved UBVRI data spanning the 1996/97 observing season indicate a surprisingly short photometric period of 2.599+/-0.001 days, which is different by 7\% from the longest seasonal period found so far but in good agreement with the long-term photometric period of 2.605 days. We interpret these differences as being due to differential surface rotation and adopt the long-term photometric period to be the rotation period of EK Dra. Our data also confirms the continuing decline of the mean brightness seen since 1994 and we suspect the high-latitude feature to be the cause.},

We suggest that this preference of high latitudes is due to the rapid rotation to these stars which leads to a dominance of the Coriolis force over the buoyancy force in the dynamics of magnetic flux tubes. As a consequence, flux tubes erupting from the deep parts of the stellar convection zone follow a path nearly parallel to the axis of rotation and thus necessarily surface at high latitudes, unless their initial field strength exceeds a critical value for which buoyancy becomes dominant again. It is shown that for stars with rotation periods below about 10 days flux tubes with such large field strength (of the order of 10 exp 6 G) cannot be formed and stored since they are unstable with respect to non-axisymmetric disturbances. Consequently, magnetically active stars with rapid rotation exhibit magnetic flux eruption at high latitudes and polar starspots.},

During the first maximum (it coincides in time with the maximum of the Wolf numbers) the solar activity increases in all heliographic latitudes but it is maximal in latitude 25° in each hemisphere. The far UV radiation and number of small spots, flares and geomagnetic disturbances with sudden commencements and without 27-day recurrences are maximum at this time. During the second maximum, which appears 2 3 years after the first one, the activity is maximal in latitudes ± 10°. At this time the biggest spots, big flares, aurora and geomagnetic disturbances with the gradual commencements and long series of 27-day recurrences appear. The variations of averaged 5303 and 6374 Å coronal line intensities may be interpreted as an increase of coronal density and temperature during the first maximum and a sharp decrease of density and temperature rise during the second one. The temperature during the second maximum is higher than that during the first one. The distribution of activity on time-latitude diagrams (so-called ‘butterflies’) is a result of superposition of two random distributions corresponding to the two maxima mentioned above.},

The longitude distribution suggests that the place where X-ray flares of class X preferentially occur migrates in Carrington longitude. In the new dynamic reference frame inferred from the differential rotation law on the Sun, the longitude distribution diagram shows that there are two persistent preferred longitudes of strong X-ray flare occurrence separated by about 180°. This suggests that strong X-ray flare active longitudes exist indeed for tens of years. The strength of the two active longitudes alternates similarly to the "flip-flop" phenomenon. The non-axisymmetry of the X-ray flare distribution is found to be highly significant 42.5\% (43.0\%) for Northern (Southern) hemisphere for the peak intensity and 55\% (49\%) for Northern (Southern) hemisphere for the flare number.},

We measure a wide range of rotation periods, from 0.28 to 154 days, with the latter commensurate with the typical sensitivity limit of our observations. Using kinematics as a proxy for age, we find that the majority of objects likely to be thick disk or halo members (and hence, on average, older) rotate very slowly, with a median period of 92 days, compared with 0.7 days for those likely to be thin disk members (on average, younger), although there are still some rapid rotators in the thick disk sample. When combined with literature measurements for M-dwarfs, these results indicate an increase in spin-down times with decreasing stellar mass, in agreement with previous work, and that the spin-down time becomes comparable to the age of the thick disk sample below the fully convective boundary. We additionally infer that the spin-down must remove a substantial amount of angular momentum once it begins in order to produce the slow rotators we observe in the thick disk candidates, suggesting that fully convective M-dwarfs may still experience strong winds.},

	abstract = {Spherical kinematic dynamo models with axisymmetric magnetic fields are examined, which arise from the mean field electrodynamics of Steenbeck and Krause, and also from the nearly axisymmetric limit of Braginskii. Four main cases are considered: (i) there is no mean flow, but the dynamo is maintained by microscale motions which create a mean electromotive force, [Note: See the image of page 663 for this formatted text] E, proportional to the mean magnetic field, B (the α effect); (ii) in addition to an α effect which creates poloidal mean field from toroidal, a mean toroidal shearing flow (angular velocity ω ) is present which creates toroidal mean field from poloidal more efficiently than by the α effect; (iii) in addition to the processes operative in (ii), a mean meridional circulation, m, is present; (iv) [Note: See the image of page 663 for this formatted text] E is produced by a second order inductive process first isolated by Radler. When these processes are sufficiently strong, they can maintain magnetic fields. The resulting situations are known as (i) α 2 dynamos, (ii) α ω dynamos, (iii) α ω dynamos with meridional circulations, and (iv) Radler dynamos. Models of each type are considered below, but cases (ii) and (iii) give rise to particularly interesting results. If {\textbar}m{\textbar} is sufficiently small, or zero [case (ii)], the most easily excited dynamo is oscillatory and is of dipole type if α ω ' {\textless} 0 in the northern hemisphere (and negative in the southern); here ω ' denotes the outward gradient of ω . The oscillation resembles a Parker dynamo wave, generated at the poles, absorbed at the equator and always moving towards lower latitudes, as for the butterfly diagrams of sunspots. If α ω ' {\textgreater} 0 in the northern hemisphere, the direction of wave motion is reversed, and also the quadrupolar solution is more readily excited than the dipolar. If {\textbar}m{\textbar} is sufficiently large, and of the right magnitude and sense (which is model dependent), it is found that the dynamo which regenerates most easily is steady. It is of dipolar form if α ω ' {\textgreater} 0 but quadrupolar if α ω ' {\textless} 0. These models appear to be relevant to the Earth, where meridional circulations might be provided by, for example, Ekman pumping. Evidence for a remarkable symmetry property is adduced. If m and α ω ' are reversed everywhere in the state in which the dipole (say) is most readily excited, it is found that the state in which a quadrupole is most easily regenerated is recovered, almost precisely. Moreover, the critical magnetic Reynolds number for each is closely similar. As a corollary, the critical Reynolds numbers for dipolar and quadrupolar solutions of opposite α ω ' are nearly identical for the α ω dynamo (m = 0).},

	abstract = {A one-dimensional climate model is used to estimate the width of the habitable zone (HZ) around our Sun and around other main sequence stars. Our basic premise is that we are dealing with Earth-like planets with CO2/H2O/N2 atmospheres and that habitability requires the presence of liquid water on the planet's surface. The inner edge of the HZ is determined in our model by loss of water via photolysis and hydrogen escape. The outer edge of the HZ is determined by the formation of CO2 clouds, which cool a planet's surface by increasing its albedo and by lowering the convective lapse rate. Conservative estimates for these distances in our own Solar System are 0.95 and 1.37 AU, respectively; the actual width of the present HZ could be much greater. Between these two limits, climate stability is ensured by a feedback mechanism in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary inversely with planetary surface temperature. The width of the HZ is slightly greater for planets that are larger than Earth and for planets which have higher N2 partial pressures. The HZ evolves outward in time because the Sun increases in luminosity as it ages. A conservative estimate for the width of the 4.6-Gyr continuously habitable zone (CHZ) is 0.95 to 1.15 AU. Stars later than F0 have main sequence lifetimes exceeding 2 Gyr and, so, are also potential candidates for harboring habitable planets. The HZ around an F star is larger and occurs farther out than for our Sun; the HZ around K and M stars is smaller and occurs farther in. Nevertheless, the widths of all of these HZs are approximately the same if distance is expressed on a logarithmic scale. A log distance scale is probably the appropriate scale for this problem because the planets in our own Solar System are spaced logarithmically and because the distance at which another star would be expected to form planets should be related to the star's mass. The width of the CHZ around other stars depends on the time that a planet is required to remain habitable and on whether a planet that is initially frozen can be thawed by modest increases in stellar luminosity. For a specified period of habitability, CHZs around K and M stars are wider (in log distance) than for our Sun because these stars evolve more slowly. Planets orbiting late K stars and M stars may not be habitable, however, because they can become trapped in synchronous rotation as a consequence of tidal damping. F stars have narrower (log distance) CHZ's than our Sun because they evolve more rapidly. Our results suggest that mid-to-early K stars should be considered along with G stars as optimal candidates in the search for extraterrestrial life.},

In this work, we stack the phase-folded transits of 284 viable moon hosting Kepler planetary candidates, in order to search for satellites. These planets range from Earth- to Jupiter-sized and from ∼0.1 to 1.0 au in separation—so-called “warm” planets. Our data processing includes two-pass harmonic detrending, transit timing variations, model selection, and careful data quality vetting to produce a grand light curve with an rms of 5.1 ppm. We find that the occurrence rate of Galilean analog moon systems for planets orbiting between ∼0.1 and 1.0 au can be constrained to be η {\textless} 0.38 to 95\% confidence for the 284 KOIs considered, with a 68.3\% confidence interval of η =\{0.16\}-0.10+0.13. A single-moon model of variable size and separation locates a slight preference for a population of short-period moons with radii ∼0.5 R ⊕ orbiting at 5-10 planetary radii. However, we stress that the low Bayes factor of just 2 in this region means it should be treated as no more than a hint at this time. Splitting our data into various physically motivated subsets reveals no strong signal. The dearth of Galilean analogs around warm planets places the first strong constraint on exomoon formation models to date. Finally, we report evidence for an exomoon candidate Kepler-1625b I, which we briefly describe ahead of scheduled observations of the target with the Hubble Space Telescope.},

	abstract = {Main sequence M stars pose an interesting problem for astrobiology: their abundance in our galaxy makes them likely targets in the hunt for habitable planets, but their strong chromospheric activity produces high-energy radiation and charged particles that may be detrimental to life. We studied the impact of the 1985 April 12 flare from the M dwarf AD Leonis (AD Leo), simulating the effects from both UV radiation and protons on the atmospheric chemistry of a hypothetical, Earth-like planet located within its habitable zone. Based on observations of solar proton events and the Neupert effect, we estimated a proton flux associated with the flare of 5.9×108 protons cm-2 sr-1 s-1 for particles with energies {\textgreater}10 MeV. Then we calculated the abundance of nitrogen oxides produced by the flare by scaling the production of these compounds during a large solar proton event called the Carrington event. The simulations were performed with a 1-D photochemical model coupled to a 1-D radiative/convective model. Our results indicate that the UV radiation emitted during the flare does not produce a significant change in the ozone column depth of the planet. When the action of protons is included, the ozone depletion reaches a maximum of 94\% two years after the flare for a planet with no magnetic field. At the peak of the flare, the calculated UV fluxes that reach the surface, in the wavelength ranges that are damaging for life, exceed those received on Earth during less than 100 s. Therefore, flares may not present a direct hazard for life on the surface of an orbiting habitable planet. Given that AD Leo is one of the most magnetically active M dwarfs known, this conclusion should apply to planets around other M dwarfs with lower levels of chromospheric activity.},

	abstract = {PLATO 2.0 has recently been selected for ESA's M3 launch opportunity (2022/24). Providing accurate key planet parameters (radius, mass, density and age) in statistical numbers, it addresses fundamental questions such as: How do planetary systems form and evolve? Are there other systems with planets like ours, including potentially habitable planets? The PLATO 2.0 instrument consists of 34 small aperture telescopes (32 with 25 s readout cadence and 2 with 2.5 s candence) providing a wide field-of-view (2232 deg 2) and a large photometric magnitude range (4-16 mag). It focusses on bright (4-11 mag) stars in wide fields to detect and characterize planets down to Earth-size by photometric transits, whose masses can then be determined by ground-based radial-velocity follow-up measurements. Asteroseismology will be performed for these bright stars to obtain highly accurate stellar parameters, including masses and ages. The combination of bright targets and asteroseismology results in high accuracy for the bulk planet parameters: 2 \%, 4-10 \% and 10 \% for planet radii, masses and ages, respectively. The planned baseline observing strategy includes two long pointings (2-3 years) to detect and bulk characterize planets reaching into the habitable zone (HZ) of solar-like stars and an additional step-and-stare phase to cover in total about 50 \% of the sky. PLATO 2.0 will observe up to 1,000,000 stars and detect and characterize hundreds of small planets, and thousands of planets in the Neptune to gas giant regime out to the HZ. It will therefore provide the first large-scale catalogue of bulk characterized planets with accurate radii, masses, mean densities and ages. This catalogue will include terrestrial planets at intermediate orbital distances, where surface temperatures are moderate. Coverage of this parameter range with statistical numbers of bulk characterized planets is unique to PLATO 2.0. The PLATO 2.0 catalogue allows us to e.g.: - complete our knowledge of planet diversity for low-mass objects, - correlate the planet mean density-orbital distance distribution with predictions from planet formation theories,- constrain the influence of planet migration and scattering on the architecture of multiple systems, and - specify how planet and system parameters change with host star characteristics, such as type, metallicity and age. The catalogue will allow us to study planets and planetary systems at different evolutionary phases. It will further provide a census for small, low-mass planets. This will serve to identify objects which retained their primordial hydrogen atmosphere and in general the typical characteristics of planets in such low-mass, low-density range. Planets detected by PLATO 2.0 will orbit bright stars and many of them will be targets for future atmosphere spectroscopy exploring their atmosphere. Furthermore, the mission has the potential to detect exomoons, planetary rings, binary and Trojan planets. The planetary science possible with PLATO 2.0 is complemented by its impact on stellar and galactic science via asteroseismology as well as light curves of all kinds of variable stars, together with observations of stellar clusters of different ages. This will allow us to improve stellar models and study stellar activity. A large number of well-known ages from red giant stars will probe the structure and evolution of our Galaxy. Asteroseismic ages of bright stars for different phases of stellar evolution allow calibrating stellar age-rotation relationships. Together with the results of ESA's Gaia mission, the results of PLATO 2.0 will provide a huge legacy to planetary, stellar and galactic science.},

The density of the Neptune-sized Kepler-4b is similar to that of Neptune and GJ 436b, even though the irradiation level is 800,000 times higher. Kepler-7b is one of the lowest-density planets ({\textasciitilde}0.17 gram per cubic centimeter) yet detected.

The strong superflare on 2M0831+2042 has an equivalent duration (ED) of 13.7 h and an estimated energy of 1.3 × 1035 erg. We observed five superflares on 2M0837+2050, on which the strongest superflare has an ED of 46.4 h and an estimated energy of 3.5 × 1035 erg. This energy is larger by 2.7 orders of magnitude than the largest flare observed on the older (7.6 Gyr) planet-hosting M8 dwarf TRAPPIST-1. Furthermore, we also observed five superflares on 2M0831+2244 which is probably a field star. The estimated energy of the strongest superflare on 2M0831+2244 is 6.1 × 1034 erg. 2M0831+2042, 2M0837+2050, and 2M0831+2244 have rotation periods of 0.556 ± 0.002, 0.193 ± 0.000, and 0.292 ± 0.001 d, respectively, which we measured by using K2 light curves. We compare the flares of younger targets with those of TRAPPIST-1 and discuss the possible impacts of such flares on planets in the habitable zone of late-M dwarfs.},

We then calibrate the morphological age indicator δ(V), which can be obtained for all remaining clusters, in terms of age and metallicity. Particular care is taken to ensure consistency in the whole procedure. The resulting Open Cluster ages connect well to our previous Globular Cluster results. From the Open Cluster sample, as well as from the combined sample, questions regarding the formation process of Galactic components are addressed. The age of the oldest open clusters (NGC 6791 and Be 17) is of the order of 10 Gyr. We determine a delay by 2.0±1.5 Gyr between the start of the halo and thin disk formation, whereas thin and thick disk started to form approximately at the same time. We do not find any significant age-metallicity relationship for the open cluster sample. The cumulative age distribution of the whole open cluster sample shows a moderately significant (∼ 2σ level) departure from the predictions for an exponentially declining dissolution rate with timescale of 2.5 Gyr. The cumulative age distribution does not show any trend with galactocentric distance, but the clusters with larger height to the Galactic plane have an excess of objects between 2-4 and 6 Gyr with respect to their counterpart closer to the plane of the Galaxy.},

Pseudomagnitudes are distance indicators which have the remarkable property of being reddening free. In this study, we use Hipparcos parallax measurements to compute the mean absolute pseudomagnitudes of solar neighbourhood dwarf stars as a function of their spectral type. To illustrate the use of absolute pseudomagnitudes, we derive the distance moduli of 360 Pleiades stars and find that the centroid of their distribution is 5.715 ± 0.018, corresponding to a distance of 139.0 ± 1.2 pc.

	abstract = {Context. At about 1000 days after the launch of Gaia we present the first Gaia data release, Gaia DR1, consisting of astrometry and photometry for over 1 billion sources brighter than magnitude 20.7. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: A summary of Gaia DR1 is presented along with illustrations of the scientific quality of the data, followed by a discussion of the limitations due to the preliminary nature of this release. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The raw data collected by Gaia during the first 14 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into an astrometric and photometric catalogue. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Gaia DR1 consists of three components: a primary astrometric data set which contains the positions, parallaxes, and mean proper motions for about 2 million of the brightest stars in common with the Hipparcos and Tycho-2 catalogues - a realisation of the Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) - and a secondary astrometric data set containing the positions for an additional 1.1 billion sources. The second component is the photometric data set, consisting of mean G-band magnitudes for all sources. The G-band light curves and the characteristics of 3000 Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, observed at high cadence around the south ecliptic pole, form the third component. For the primary astrometric data set the typical uncertainty is about 0.3 mas for the positions and parallaxes, and about 1 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} for the proper motions. A systematic component of 0.3 mas should be added to the parallax uncertainties. For the subset of 94 000 Hipparcos stars in the primary data set, the proper motions are much more precise at about 0.06 mas yr{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. For the secondary astrometric data set, the typical uncertainty of the positions is 10 mas. The median uncertainties on the mean G-band magnitudes range from the mmag level to 0.03 mag over the magnitude range 5 to 20.7. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Gaia DR1 is an important milestone ahead of the next Gaia data release, which will feature five-parameter astrometry for all sources. Extensive validation shows that Gaia DR1 represents a major advance in the mapping of the heavens and the availability of basic stellar data that underpin observational astrophysics. Nevertheless, the very preliminary nature of this first Gaia data release does lead to a number of important limitations to the data quality which should be carefully considered before drawing conclusions from the data.},

	abstract = {Context. It is well known that the magnetic activity of solar-type stars decreases with age, but it is widely debated in the literature whether there is a smooth decline or if there is an early sharp drop until 1-2 Gyr that is followed by a relatively inactive constant phase. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We revisited the activity-age relation using time-series observations of a large sample of solar twins whose precise isochronal ages and other important physical parameters have been determined. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We measured the Ca II H and K activity indices using ≈9000 HARPS spectra of 82 solar twins. In addition, the average solar activity was calculated through asteroids and Moon reflection spectra using the same instrumentation. Thus, we transformed our activity indices into the S Mount Wilson scale (S{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}MW{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), recalibrated the Mount Wilson absolute flux and photospheric correction equations as a function of T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and then computed an improved bolometric flux normalized activity index log R'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}HK{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) for the entire sample. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: New relations between activity and the age of solar twins were derived by assessing the chromospheric age-dating limits using log R'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}HK{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}). We measured an average solar activity of S{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}MW{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.1712 ± 0.0017 during solar magnetic cycles 23-24 covered by HARPS observations, and we also inferred an average of S{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}MW{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.1694 ± 0.0025 for cycles 10-24, anchored on a sunspot number correlation of S index versus. We also found a simple relation between the average and the dispersion of the activity levels of solar twins. This enabled us to predict the stellar variability effects on the age-activity diagram, and consequently, to estimate the chromospheric age uncertainties that are due to the same phenomena. The age-activity relation is still statistically significant up to ages around 6-7 Gyr, in agreement with previous works using open clusters and field stars with precise ages. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our research confirms that Ca II H \&amp; K lines remain a useful chromospheric evolution tracer until stars reach ages of at least 6-7 Gyr. We found evidence that for the most homogenous set of old stars, the chromospheric activity indices seem to continue to decrease after the solar age toward the end of the main sequence. Our results indicate that a significant part of the scatter observed in the age-activity relation of solar twins can be attributed to stellar cycle modulations effects. The Sun seems to have a normal activity level and variability for its age. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO programs 188.C-0265, 183.D-0729, 292.C-5004, 097.C-0571, 092.C-0721, 093.C-0409, 072.C-0488, 183.C-0972, 091.C-0936, 192.C-0852, 196.C-1006, 076.C-0155, 096.C-0499, 185.D-0056, 192.C-0224, 075.C-0332, 090.C-0421, 091.C-0034, 077.C-0364, 089.C-0415, 60.A-9036, 092.C-0832, 295.C-5035, 295.C-5031, 60.A-9700, 289.D-5015, 096.C-0210, 086.C-0284, 088.C-0323, 0100.D-0444, and 099.C-0491.Tables 1 and 2 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/619/A73"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/619/A73{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Open clusters are essential tools for understanding Galactic structure, as well as stellar evolution, because they are distributed over the whole Galactic plane, and because their ages, distances, and reddening can be determined. The values of derived cluster fundamental parameters can vary greatly because of the often subjective nature of both the isochrone fitting technique and member star selection. To minimize the subjectivity in the selection of stars and to improve the fitting procedure, our group has developed a nonparametric method that estimates the membership likelihood for apparent cluster stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The cluster member selection method is based on the star position relative to the cluster center, the density of stars in the color-magnitude diagram (which can be multidimensional), the photometric errors, and the limiting magnitude of observations. We use this method, together with the global optimization tool developed in our previous articles, to fit theoretical isochrones to open cluster photometric data, making use of UBV and 2MASS data sets. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Using this likelihood estimation as a weight in the fitting procedure, we show that the method is robust in that it assigns low weights to most contaminating stars and high weights to the stars that are likely cluster members. Our results show that the fundamental parameters determined using 2MASS data agree with those from UBV data when both are determined from the global optimization fitting method, however, the analysis of the open cluster {\textless}ASTROBJ{\textgreater}Dias 6{\textless}/ASTROBJ{\textgreater} indicates that a revision of the determined parameters might be required for some cases. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Figures 3-30 are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

However, even in the most optimistic scenario, uncertainty in age determination for field stars and lack of sufficient data in open clusters make any attempt of calibrating an age activity relationship for old stars premature.

	abstract = {Context. The photometric and astrometric measurements of the Pleiades DANCe DR2 survey provide an excellent test case for the benchmarking of statistical tools aiming at the disentanglement and characterisation of nearby young open cluster (NYOC) stellar populations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We aim to develop, test, and characterise of a new statistical tool (intelligent system) for the sifting and analysis of NYOC populations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Using a Bayesian formalism, with this statistical tool we were able to obtain the posterior distributions of parameters governing the cluster model. It also used hierarchical bayesian models to establish weakly informative priors, and incorporates the treatment of missing values and non-homogeneous (heteroscedastic) observational uncertainties. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: From simulations, we estimated that this statistical tool renders kinematic (proper motion) and photometric (luminosity) distributions of the cluster population with a contamination rate of 5.8 ± 0.2\%. The luminosity distributions and present day mass function agree with the ones found in a recent study, on the completeness interval of the survey. At the probability threshold of maximum accuracy, the classifier recovers ≈90\% of the recently published candidate members and finds 10\% of new ones. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: A new statistical tool for the analysis of NYOC is introduced, tested, and characterised. Its comprehensive modelling of the data properties allows it to get rid of the biases present in previous works. In particular, those resulting from the use of only completely observed (non-missing) data and the assumption of homoskedastic uncertainties. Also, its Bayesian framework allows it to properly propagate observational uncertainties into membership probabilities and cluster velocity and luminosity distributions.

	abstract = {Context. The Mount Wilson Ca II index log(R'\_HK) is the accepted standard metric of calibration for the chromospheric activity versus age relation for FGK stars. Recent results claim its inability to discern activity levels, and thus ages, for stars older than {\textasciitilde}2 Gyr, which would severely hamper its application to date disk stars older than the Sun. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present a new activity-age calibration of the Mt. Wilson index that explicitly takes mass and [Fe/H] biases into account; these biases are implicit in samples of stars selected to have precise ages, which have so far not been appreciated. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We show that these selection biases tend to blur the activity-age relation for large age ranges. We calibrate the Mt. Wilson index for a sample of field FGK stars with precise ages, covering a wide range of mass and [Fe/H] , augmented with data from the Pleiades, Hyades, M 67 clusters, and the Ursa Major moving group. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We further test the calibration with extensive new Gemini/GMOS log ()R'{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}HK{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) data of the old, solar [Fe/H] clusters, M 67 and NGC 188. The observed NGC 188 activity level is clearly lower than M 67. We correctly recover the isochronal age of both clusters and establish the viability of deriving usable chromospheric ages for solar-type stars up to at least {\textasciitilde}6 Gyr, where average errors are {\textasciitilde}0.14 dex provided that we explicitly account for the mass and [Fe/H] dimensions. We test our calibration against asteroseismological ages, finding excellent correlation (ρ = + 0.89). We show that our calibration improves the chromospheric age determination for a wide range of ages, masses, and metallicities in comparison to previous age-activity relations.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a new study on the relationship between coronal X-ray emission and stellar rotation in late-type main-sequence stars. We have selected a sample of 259 dwarfs in the B-V range 0.5-2.0, including 110 field stars and 149 members of the Pleiades, Hyades, alpha Persei, IC 2602 and IC 2391 open clusters. All the stars have been observed with ROSAT, and most of them have photometrically-measured rotation periods available. Our results confirm that two emission regimes exist, one in which the rotation period is a good predictor of the total X-ray luminosity, and the other in which a constant saturated X-ray to bolometric luminosity ratio is attained; we present a quantitative estimate of the critical rotation periods below which stars of different masses (or spectral types) enter the saturated regime. In this work we have also empirically derived a characteristic time scale, tau{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}e{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} , which we have used to investigate the relationship between the X-ray emission level and an X-ray-based Rossby number R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}e{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/tau{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}e{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}: we show that our empirical time scale tau{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}e{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} resembles the theoretical convective turnover time for 0.4 \&lt;{\textasciitilde} M/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}sun{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt;{\textasciitilde} 1.2, but it also has the same functional dependence on B-V as L{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}bol{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}-1/2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} in the color range 0.5 \&lt;{\textasciitilde} B-V \&lt;{\textasciitilde} 1.5.

Using rotation, X-ray, EUV, and Ly-α measurements, we derive empirical relations for the dependences of high energy emission on stellar parameters. Our description of X-ray evolution is validated using measurements of X-ray distributions in young clusters. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: A star's X-ray, EUV, and Ly-α evolution is determined by its mass and initial rotation rate, with initial rotation being less important for lower mass stars. At all ages, solar mass stars are significantly more X-ray luminous than lower mass stars and stars that are born as rapid rotators remain highly active longer than those born as slow rotators. At all evolutionary stages, habitable zone planets receive higher X-ray and EUV fluxes when orbiting lower mass stars due to their longer evolutionary timescales. The rates of flares follow similar evolutionary trends with higher mass stars flaring more often than lower mass stars at all ages, though habitable zone planets are likely influenced by flares more when orbiting lower mass stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Our results show that single decay laws are insufficient to describe stellar activity evolution and highlight the need for a more comprehensive description based on the evolution of rotation that also includes the effects of short-term variability. Planets at similar orbital distances from their host stars receive significantly more X-ray and EUV energy over their lifetimes when orbiting higher mass stars. The common belief that M dwarfs are more X-ray and EUV active than G dwarfs is justified only when considering the fluxes received by planets with similar effective temperatures, such as those in the habitable zone. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Our code for calculating stellar rotation and XUV evolution is available at {\textless}A href="https://github.com/ColinPhilipJohnstone/Mors"{\textgreater}https://github.com/ColinPhilipJohnstone/Mors{\textless}/A{\textgreater} and an extensive grid of evolutionary tracks is available at {\textless}A href="https://zenodo.org/record/4266670\#.X6rMuq4o9H5"{\textgreater}https://zenodo.org/record/4266670\#.X6rMuq4o9H5{\textless}/A{\textgreater}.},

The frequency and main characteristics of multiple systems, and their dependence on primary mass and environment, are powerful tools to probe this process. Although early attempts were fraught with selection biases and limited completeness, instrumentation breakthroughs in the past two decades now enable robust statistical analyses. In this review, we summarize current empirical knowledge of stellar multiplicity for main sequence stars and brown dwarfs, as well as among populations of pre-main-sequence stars and embedded protostars. Among field objects, the multiplicity rate and breadth of the orbital period distribution are steep functions of the primary mass, whereas the mass ratio distribution is essentially flat for most populations other than the lowest mass objects. The time-variation of the frequency of visual companions follows two parallel, constant tracks corresponding to loose and dense stellar populations, although current observations do not yet distinguish whether initial multiplicity properties are universal or dependent on the physical conditions of the parent cloud. Nonetheless, these quantitative trends provide a rich comparison basis for numerical and analytical models of star formation.},

	abstract = {Using light curves obtained by the K2 mission, we study the relation between stellar rotation and magnetic activity with special focus on stellar flares. Our sample comprises 56 bright and nearby M dwarfs observed by K2 during campaigns C0-C18 in long- and short-cadence mode. We derive rotation periods for 46 M dwarfs and measure photometric activity indicators such as amplitude of the rotational signal, standard deviation of the light curves, and the basic flare properties (flare rate, flare energy, flare duration, and flare amplitude). We found 1662 short-cadence flares, 363 of which have a long-cadence counterpart with flare energies of up to 5.6 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}34{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg. The flare amplitude, duration, and frequency derived from the short-cadence light curves differ significantly from those derived from the long-cadence data. The analysis of the short-cadence light curves results in a flare rate that is 4.6 times higher than the long-cadence data. We confirm the abrupt change in activity level in the rotation-activity relation at a critical period of {\textasciitilde}10 d when photometric activity diagnostics are used. This change is most drastic in the flare duration and frequency for short-cadence data. Our flare studies revealed that the highest flare rates are not found among the fastest rotators and that stars with the highest flare rates do not show the most energetic flares. We found that the superflare frequency (E ≥ 5 × 10{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}34{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} erg) for the fast-rotating M stars is twice higher than for solar like stars in the same period range. By fitting the cumulative FFD, we derived a power-law index of α = 1.84 ± 0.14, consistent with previous M dwarf studies and the value found for the Sun. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Tables B.1 and B.2 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/637/A22"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/637/A22{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

We identify this signal as continuum emission emitted by WLFs and find that it is consistent with a blackbody emission at {\textasciitilde}9000 K. We estimate the contribution of the WL continuum for several sets of flares and find it to be about 70\% of the total radiated energy.

An X-ray flare from the active star seen with Swift/XRT 8 h before the second-epoch observation supports the idea that the observed changes within the upper atmosphere of the planet can be caused by variations in the stellar wind properties, or by variations in the stellar energy input to the planetary escaping gas (or a mix of the two effects). These observations provide the first indication of interaction between the exoplanet's atmosphere and stellar variations.},

	abstract = {The main challenge for the theory of solar eruptions has been to understand two basic aspects of large flares. These are the cause of the flare itself and the nature of the morphological features which form during its evolution. Such features include separating ribbons of Hα emission joined by a rising arcade of soft x-ray loops, with hard x-ray emission at their summits and at their feet. Two major advances in our understanding of the theory of solar flares have recently occurred. The first is the realisation that a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) catastrophe is probably responsible for the basic eruption and the second is that the eruption is likely to drive a reconnection process in the field lines stretched out by the eruption. The reconnection is responsible for the ribbons and the set of rising soft x-ray loops, and such a process is well supported by numerical experiments and detailed observations from the Japanese satellite Yohkoh. Magnetic energy conversion by reconnection in two dimensions is relatively well understood, but in three dimensions we are only starting to understand the complexity of the magnetic topology and the MHD dynamics which are involved. How the dynamics lead to particle acceleration is even less well understood. Particle acceleration in flares may in principle occur in a variety of ways, such as stochastic acceleration by MHD turbulence, acceleration by direct electric fields at the reconnection site, or diffusive shock acceleration at the different kinds of MHD shock waves that are produced during the flare. However, which of these processes is most important for producing the energetic particles that strike the solar surface remains a mystery.},

It is therefore well suited for testing stellar evolution models and for obtaining precise and detailed chemical abundance information. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We combined photometric and astrometric information coming from literature and the Gaia mission with very high-resolution optical spectra of stars in different evolutionary stages to derive the cluster distance, age, and detailed chemical composition. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We obtained spectra of six red giants using HARPS-N at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). We also used European Southern Observatory (ESO) archive spectra of 22 main sequence (MS) stars, observed with HARPS at the 3.6 m telescope. The very high resolution (115 000) and the large wavelength coverage (about 380-680 nm) of the twin instruments permitted us to derive atmospheric parameters, metallicity, and detailed chemical abundances of 23 species from all nucleosynthetic channels. We employed both equivalent widths and spectrum synthesis. We also re-derived the cluster distance and age using Gaia parallaxes, proper motions, and photometry in conjunction with the PARSEC stellar evolutionary models. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We fully analysed those stars with radial velocity and proper motion/parallax in agreement with the cluster mean values. We also discarded one binary not previously recognised, and six stars near the MS turn-off because of their high rotation velocity. Our final sample consists of 21 stars (six giants and 15 MS stars). We measured metallicity (the cluster average [Fe/H] is +0.08, rms = 0.07) and abundances of light, α, Fe-peak, and neutron-capture elements. The Li abundance follows the expectations, showing a tight relation between temperature and abundance on the MS, at variance with M 67, and we did not detect any Li-rich giant. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We confirm that Rup 147 is the oldest nearby open cluster.

Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}BP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (330-680 nm) and G{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}RP{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

	abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}{\textless}A href="http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia"{\textgreater}http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context. Galactic open clusters (OCs) mainly belong to the young stellar population in the Milky Way disk, but are there groups and complexes of OCs that possibly define an additional level in hierarchical star formation? Current compilations are too incomplete to address this question, especially regarding radial velocities (RVs) and metallicities ([M/H]). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Here we provide and discuss newly obtained RV and [M/H] data, which will enable us to reinvestigate potential groupings of open clusters and associations. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We extracted additional RVs and [M/H] from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) via a cross-match with the Catalogue of Stars in Open Cluster Areas (CSOCA). For the identified OCs in RAVE we derived overlineRV and overline\{[M/H]\} from a cleaned working sample and compared the results with previous findings. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: Although our RAVE sample does not show the same accuracy as the entire survey, we were able to derive reliable overlineRV for 110 Galactic open clusters. For 37 OCs we publish overlineRV for the first time. Moreover, we determined overline\{[M/H]\} for 81 open clusters, extending the number of OCs with overline\{[M/H]\} by 69. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Tables 8 and 9 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/562/A54"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/562/A54{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context. Open clusters have long been used to gain insights into the structure, composition, and evolution of the Galaxy. With the large amount of stellar data available for many clusters in the Gaia era, new techniques must be developed for analyzing open clusters, as visual inspection of cluster color-magnitude diagrams is no longer feasible. An automatic tool will be required to analyze large samples of open clusters. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We seek to develop an automatic isochrone-fitting procedure to consistently determine cluster membership and the fundamental cluster parameters. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Our cluster characterization pipeline first determined cluster membership with precise astrometry, primarily from TGAS and HSOY. With initial cluster members established, isochrones were fitted, using a χ{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} minimization, to the cluster photometry in order to determine cluster mean distances, ages, and reddening. Cluster membership was also refined based on the stellar photometry. We used multiband photometry, which includes ASCC-2.5 BV, 2MASS JHK{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and Gaia G band. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We present parameter estimates for all 24 clusters closer than 333 pc as determined by the Catalogue of Open Cluster Data and the Milky Way Star Clusters catalog. We find that our parameters are consistent to those in the Milky Way Star Clusters catalog. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We demonstrate that it is feasible to develop an automated pipeline that determines cluster parameters and membership reliably. After additional modifications, our pipeline will be able to use Gaia DR2 as input, leading to better cluster memberships and more accurate cluster parameters for a much larger number of clusters. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Tables C.1-C.24 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/615/A12"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/615/A12{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context. The global Milky Way Star Clusters (MWSC) survey provided new cluster membership lists and mean cluster parameters for nearly 80\% of all previously known Galactic clusters. The MWSC data reduction pipeline involved the catalogue of positions and proper motions (PPMXL) on the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS) and near-infrared photometry from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: In the first extension to the MWSC, photometric filters were applied to the 2MASS catalogue to find new cluster candidates that were subsequently confirmed or rejected by the MWSC pipeline. To further extend the MWSC census, particularly of nearby clusters, we aimed at discovering new clusters by conducting an almost global search in proper motion catalogues as a starting point. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We first selected high-quality samples from the PPMXL and the Fourth US Naval Observatory CCD Astrograph Catalog (UCAC4) for comparison and verification of the proper motions. For 441 circular proper motion bins (radius 15 mas/yr) within ±50 mas/yr, the sky outside a thin Galactic plane zone ({\textbar} b {\textbar} \&lt; 5°) was binned in small areas ("sky pixels") of 0.25 × 0.25 deg{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}. Sky pixels with enhanced numbers of stars with a certain common proper motion in both catalogues were considered as cluster candidates. After visual inspection of the sky images, we built an automated procedure that combined these representations of the sky for neighbouring proper motion subsamples after a background correction. The 692 compact cluster candidates detected above a threshold that was equivalent to a minimum of 12 to 130 cluster stars in dependence on the Galactic latitude were then cross-checked with known star clusters and clusters of galaxies. New candidates served as input for the MWSC pipeline. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: About half of our candidates overlapped with known clusters (46 globular and 68 open clusters in the Galaxy, about 150 known clusters of galaxies) or the Magellanic Clouds. About 10\% of our candidates are 63 new open clusters confirmed by the MWSC pipeline. They predominantly occupy the two inner Galactic quadrants and have apparent sizes and numbers of highly probable members slightly larger than those of the typically small MWSC clusters, whereas their other parameters (ages, distances, tidal radii) fall in the typical ranges. As we searched for compact clusters, we did not find new very nearby (extended) clusters, and the mean total proper motion of the new 63 clusters is with 6.3 mas/yr similar to the MWSC average (5.5 mas/yr). Only four new clusters have mean proper motions between 10 mas/yr and our observed maximum of about 13 mas/yr. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}The full tables with all determined cluster parameters are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr{\textless}/A{\textgreater} (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via {\textless}A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/581/A39"{\textgreater}http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/581/A39{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Context. The rich open cluster M67 is known to have a chemical composition close to solar, and an age around 4 Gyr. It thus offers the opportunity to check our understanding of the physics and the evolution of solar-type stars in a cluster environment. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We present the first spectroscopic study at high resolution, R ≈ 50 000, of the potentially best solar twin, M67-1194, identified among solar-like stars in M67. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: G dwarfs in M67 (d ≈ 900 pc) are relatively faint (V ≈ 15), which makes detailed spectroscopic studies time-consuming. Based on a pre-selection of solar-twin candidates performed at medium resolution by Pasquini et al. (2008, A\&amp;A, 489, 677), we explore the chemical-abundance similarities and differences between M67-1194 and the Sun, using VLT/FLAMES-UVES. Working with a solar twin in the framework of a differential analysis, we minimize systematic model errors in the abundance analysis compared to previous studies which utilized more evolved stars to determine the metallicity of M67. The differential approach yields precise and accurate chemical abundances for M67, which enhances the possibility to use this object in studies of the potential peculiarity, or normality, of the Sun. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find M67-1194 to have stellar parameters indistinguishable from the solar values, with the exception of the overall metallicity which is slightly super-solar ([Fe/H] = 0.023 ± 0.015). An age determination based on evolutionary tracks yields 4.2 ± 1.6 Gyr. Most surprisingly, we find the chemical abundance pattern to closely resemble the solar one, in contrast to most known solar twins in the solar neighbourhood. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We confirm the solar-twin nature of M67-1194, the first solar twin known to belong to a stellar association. This fact allows us to put some constraints on the physical reasons for the seemingly systematic departure of M67-1194 and the Sun from most known solar twins regarding chemical composition. We find that radiative dust cleansing by nearby luminous stars may be the explanation for the peculiar composition of both the Sun and M67-1194, but alternative explanations are also possible. The chemical similarity between the Sun and M67-1194 also suggests that the Sun once formed in a cluster like M67. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Based on data obtained at ESO-VLT, Paranal Observatory, Chile, Program ID 082.D-0726(A).Appendix A is only available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

Because of the wide wavelength range used, our results substantially improve the accuracy and precision of previous extinction and effective temperature estimates. After cleaning our results for both unreliable input and output data, we retain 137 million stars, for which we achieve a median precision of 5\% in distance, 0.20 mag in V-band extinction, and 245 K in effective temperature for G ≤ 14, degrading towards fainter magnitudes (12\%, 0.20 mag, and 245 K at G = 16; 16\%, 0.23 mag, and 260 K at G = 17, respectively). We find a very good agreement with the asteroseismic surface gravities and distances of 7000 stars in the Kepler, K2-C3, and K2-C6 fields, with stellar parameters from the APOGEE survey, and with distances to star clusters. Our results are available through the ADQL query interface of the Gaia mirror at the Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (gaia.aip.de) and as binary tables at data.aip.de. As a first application, we provide distance- and extinction-corrected colour-magnitude diagrams, extinction maps as a function of distance, and extensive density maps. These demonstrate the potential of our value-added dataset for mapping the three-dimensional structure of our Galaxy. In particular, we see a clear manifestation of the Galactic bar in the stellar density distributions, an observation that can almost be considered direct imaging of the Galactic bar.},

	abstract = {The Gaia satellite will survey the entire celestial sphere down to 20th magnitude, obtaining astrometry, photometry, and low resolution spectrophotometry on one billion astronomical sources, plus radial velocities for over one hundred million stars. Itsmain objective is to take a census of the stellar content of our Galaxy, with the goal of revealing its formation and evolution. Gaia's unique feature is the measurement of parallaxes and proper motions with hitherto unparalleled accuracy for many objects. As a survey, the physical properties of most of these objects are unknown. Here we describe the data analysis system put together by the Gaia consortium to classify these objects and to infer their astrophysical properties using the satellite's data. This system covers single stars, (unresolved) binary stars, quasars, and galaxies, all covering a wide parameter space. Multiple methods are used for many types of stars, producing multiple results for the end user according to different models and assumptions. Prior to its application to real Gaia data the accuracy of these methods cannot be assessed definitively. But as an example of the current performance, we can attain internal accuracies (rms residuals) on F, G, K, M dwarfs and giants at G = 15 (V = 15-17) for a wide range of metallicites and interstellar extinctions of around 100 K in effective temperature (T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), 0.1 mag in extinction (A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), 0.2 dex in metallicity ([Fe/H]), and 0.25 dex in surface gravity (log g). The accuracy is a strong function of the parameters themselves, varying by a factor of more than two up or down over this parameter range. After its launch in December 2013, Gaia will nominally observe for five years, during which the system we describe will continue to evolve in light of experience with the real data.},

	abstract = {The second Gaia data release (Gaia DR2) contains, beyond the astrometry, three-band photometry for 1.38 billion sources. One band is the G band, the other two were obtained by integrating the Gaia prism spectra (BP and RP). We have used these three broad photometric bands to infer stellar effective temperatures, T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, for all sources brighter than G = 17 mag with T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} in the range 3000-10 000 K (some 161 million sources). Using in addition the parallaxes, we infer the line-of-sight extinction, A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}G{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, and the reddening, E(BP - RP), for 88 million sources. Together with a bolometric correction we derive luminosity and radius for 77 million sources. These quantities as well as their estimated uncertainties are part of Gaia DR2. Here we describe the procedures by which these quantities were obtained, including the underlying assumptions, comparison with literature estimates, and the limitations of our results. Typical accuracies are of order 324 K (T{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}eff{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), 0.46 mag (A{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}G{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}), 0.23 mag (E(BP - RP)), 15\% (luminosity), and 10\% (radius). Being based on only a small number of observable quantities and limited training data, our results are necessarily subject to some extreme assumptions that can lead to strong systematics in some cases (not included in the aforementioned accuracy estimates). One aspect is the non-negativity contraint of our estimates, in particular extinction, which we discuss. Yet in several regions of parameter space our results show very good performance, for example for red clump stars and solar analogues. Large uncertainties render the extinctions less useful at the individual star level, but they show good performance for ensemble estimates. We identify regimes in which our parameters should and should not be used and we define a "clean" sample. Despite the limitations, this is the largest catalogue of uniformly-inferred stellar parameters to date. More precise and detailed astrophysical parameters based on the full BP/RP spectrophotometry are planned as part of the third Gaia data release.},

We find 93 candidates orbit flare stars and measure their flare frequency distributions. Across the sample, TOIs of ≤1.5R⊕ orbit flare stars more frequently than do TOIs of 1.5⊕, 2.75⊕, or R≥4R⊕. We sort all TOI host stars by their flare rate/upper limit, stellar mass, and distance to create a flare ranking metric (FRM) to determine suitability for follow-up. The FRM of each TOI is then checked against the expected signal-to-noise of atmospheric features in transmission spectroscopy to locate the most promising targets. We find 1/4 of terrestrial M-dwarf planets amenable to transmission spectroscopy orbit flare stars. However, none of the M-dwarf hosts to terrestrial planets are currently flaring at sufficient levels for {\textgreater}99.9 per cent atmospheric ozone depletion. We give the first upper limits on the flare rate of the host star to TOI 700 d and explore the flare rates incident on young planets such as DS Tuc Ab.},

	abstract = {Understanding convection in red supergiants and the mechanisms that trigger the mass loss from these evolved stars are the general goals of most observations of Betelgeuse and its inner circumstellar environment. Linear spectropolarimetry of the atomic lines of the spectrum of Betelgeuse reveals information about the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of brightness in its atmosphere. We model the distribution of plasma and its velocities and use inversion algorithms to fit the observed linear polarization. We obtain the first 3D images of the photosphere of Betelgeuse. Within the limits of the used approximations, we recover vertical convective flows and measure the velocity of the rising plasma at different heights in the photosphere. In several cases, we find this velocity to be constant with height, indicating the presence of forces other than gravity acting on the plasma and counteracting it. In some cases, these forces are sufficient to maintain plasma rising at 60{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}kms to heights where this velocity is comparable to the escape velocity. Forces are present in the photosphere of Betelgeuse that allow plasma to reach velocities close to the escape velocity. These mechanisms may suffice to trigger mass loss and sustain the observed large stellar winds of these evolved stars.},

The aim of our work is to analyze the light curves of \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic recently observed by TESS in sectors 32, 33, and 34, searching for the signatures of exocomet transits. Methods. We process the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic light curves from the MAST database, applying the frequency analysis to remove harmonic signals due to the star's pulsations and use a simple 1-D model to fit the profiles of the found events. Results. We recover events previously found by other authors in sectors 5 and 6 and find five new distinct aperiodic dipping events with asymmetric shapes resembling the expected profiles due to the passage of a comet-like body across the star disk. These dips are rather shallow, with the flux drop at a level of 0.03{\textbackslash}\% and a duration of less than 1 day. No periodic transits were found in the sectors investigated. Conclusions. The depth and duration of the identified dips are similar to the recently discovered transits in the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic light curves from sector 5 of the TESS observations as well as to those found in the light curves of KIC 354116 and KIC 1108472 from the Kepler database. It indicates that aperiodic shallow dips are not likely an exceptional phenomenon, at least for the \${\textbackslash}beta\$ Pic system.},

	abstract = {Transit observations in the helium triplet around 10830 Angstrom are a successful tool to study exoplanetary atmospheres and their mass loss. Forming those lines requires ionisation and recombination of helium in the exoplanetary atmosphere. This ionisation is caused by stellar photons at extreme ultra-violet (EUV) wavelengths; however, no currently active telescopes can observe this part of the stellar spectrum. The relevant part of the stellar EUV spectrum consists of individual emission lines, many of them being formed by iron at coronal temperatures. The stellar iron abundance in the corona is often observed to be depleted for high-activity low-mass stars due to the first ionisation potential (FIP) effect. I show that stars with high versus low coronal iron abundances follow different scaling laws that tie together their X-ray emission and the narrow-band EUV flux that causes helium ionisation. I also show that the stellar iron to oxygen abundance ratio in the corona can be measured reasonably well from X-ray CCD spectra, yielding similar results to high-resolution X-ray observations. Taking coronal iron abundance into account, the currently observed large scatter in the relationship of EUV irradiation with exoplanetary helium transit depths can be reduced, improving the target selection criteria for exoplanet transmission spectroscopy. In particular, previously puzzling non-detections of helium for Neptunic exoplanets are now in line with expectations from the revised scaling laws.},

	abstract = {We report the discovery of TOI-2119b, a transiting brown dwarf (BD) that orbits and is completely eclipsed by an active M-dwarf star. Using light curve data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission and follow up high-resolution Doppler spectroscopic observations, we find the BD has a radius of \$R\_b = 1.08 {\textbackslash}pm 0.03\{{\textbackslash}rm R\_J\}\$, a mass of \$M\_b = 64.4 {\textbackslash}pm 2.3\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_J\}\$, an orbital period of \$P = 7.200865 {\textbackslash}pm 0.00002\$ days, and an eccentricity of \$e=0.337{\textbackslash}pm 0.002\$. The host star has a mass of \$M\_{\textbackslash}star = 0.53 {\textbackslash}pm 0.02\{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, a radius of \$R\_{\textbackslash}star= 0.50 {\textbackslash}pm 0.01\{{\textbackslash}rm R\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, an effective temperature of \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 3621 {\textbackslash}pm 48\{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\$, and a metallicity of \${\textbackslash}rm [Fe/H]=+0.06{\textbackslash}pm 0.08\$. TOI-2119b joins an emerging population of transiting BDs around M-dwarf host stars, with TOI-2119 being the ninth such system. These M-dwarf--brown dwarf systems occupy mass ratios near \$q = M\_b/M\_{\textbackslash}star {\textbackslash}approx 0.1\$, which separates them from the typical mass ratios for systems with transiting substellar objects and giant exoplanets that orbit more massive stars. TOI-2119 is also one of the most active M-dwarf stars known to host a transiting brown dwarf. The nature of the secondary eclipse of the BD by the star enables us to estimate the effective temperature of the substellar object to be \$2030{\textbackslash}pm 84 \{{\textbackslash}rm K\}\$, which is consistent with predictions by substellar evolutionary models.},

	abstract = {We present stellar wind modelling of the hot Jupiter host HD189733, and predict radio emission from the stellar wind and the planet, the latter arising from the interaction of the stellar wind with the planetary magnetosphere. Our stellar wind models incorporate surface stellar magnetic field maps at the epochs 2013 June/July, 2014 September, and 2015 July as boundary conditions. We find that the mass-loss rate, angular momentum loss rate, and open magnetic flux of HD189733 vary by 9 per cent, 40 per cent, and 19 per cent over these three epochs. Solving the equations of radiative transfer, we find that from 10 MHz-100 GHz the stellar wind emits fluxes in the range of 10-3-5 μJy, and becomes optically thin above 10 GHz. Our planetary radio emission model uses the radiometric Bode's law, and neglects the presence of a planetary atmosphere. For assumed planetary magnetic fields of 1-10 G, we estimate that the planet emits at frequencies of 2-25 MHz, with peak flux densities of 102 mJy. We find that the planet orbits through regions of the stellar wind that are optically thick to the emitted frequency from the planet. As a result, unattenuated planetary radio emission can only propagate out of the system and reach the observer for 67 per cent of the orbit for a 10 G planetary field, corresponding to when the planet is approaching and leaving primary transit. We also find that the plasma frequency of the stellar wind is too high to allow propagation of the planetary radio emission below 21 MHz. This means a planetary field of at least 8 G is required to produce detectable radio emission.},

	abstract = {Despite many attempts to detect radio emissions from magnetized exoplanets, a reproducible, unambiguous detection remains elusive. On the other hand, the search for periodic radio emissions from exoplanet host stars that may be induced by star-planet interactions in, for example, hot Jupiter systems, has only recently begun. In this third paper of the ROME (Radio Observations of Magnetized Exoplanets) series, we present the results of a targeted radio survey of 17 nearby systems that host exoplanet, brown dwarf, and low-mass stellar companions conducted with the Arecibo radio telescope at \${\textbackslash}sim\$5 GHz. This GHz-frequency survey has the greatest frequency coverage of any to date, while providing mJy-level sensitivity over \${\textless}\$1 s integration times. Neither auroral radio emissions from the substellar targets, nor exoplanet-induced stellar radio bursts were detected. These results are considered within the context of observed brown dwarf radio emissions, which support magnetospheric phenomenon similar to that found at Jupiter. We also describe the orbital phase coverage of our data for systems that may feature star-planet interactions, and briefly examine our results within the context of other searches for star-planet interactions within the same systems. Finally, as several of our targets are within their respective systems' habitable zones, we consider the implications of our survey on the search for technosignatures within those systems.},

	abstract = {New sets of young M dwarfs with complex, sharp-peaked, and strictly periodic photometric modulations have recently been discovered with Kepler/K2 (scallop shells) and TESS (complex rotators). All are part of star-forming associations, are distinct from other variable stars, and likely belong to a unified class. Suggested hypotheses include star spots, accreting dust disks, co-rotating clouds of material, magnetically constrained material, spots and misaligned disks, and pulsations. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview and add new observational constraints with TESS and SPECULOOS Southern Observatory (SSO) photometry. We scrutinize all hypotheses from three new angles: (1) we investigate each scenario's occurrence rates via young star catalogs; (2) we study the features' longevity using over one year of combined data; and (3) we probe the expected color dependency with multi-color photometry. In this process, we also revisit the stellar parameters accounting for activity effects, study stellar flares as activity indicators over year-long time scales, and develop toy models to simulate typical morphologies. We rule out most hypotheses, and only (i) co-rotating material clouds and (ii) spots and misaligned disks remain feasible - with caveats. For (i), co-rotating dust might not be stable enough, while co-rotating gas alone likely cannot cause percentage-scale features; and (ii) would require misaligned disks around most young M dwarfs. We thus suggest a unified hypothesis, a superposition of large-amplitude spot modulations and sharp transits of co-rotating gas clouds. While the complex rotators' mystery remains, these new observations add valuable pieces to the puzzle going forward.},

Here we analyse three transits of AU Mic b observed with the CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), supplemented with sector 1 and 27 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry, and the All-Sky Automated Survey from the ground. The refined orbital period of AU Mic b is 8.462995 ± 0.000003 d, whereas the stellar rotational period is P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 4.8367 ± 0.0006 d. The two periods indicate a 7:4 spin-orbit commensurability at a precision of 0.1\%. Therefore, all transits are observed in front of one of the four possible stellar central longitudes. This is strongly supported by the observation that the same complex star-spot pattern is seen in the second and third CHEOPS visits that were separated by four orbits (and seven stellar rotations). Using a bootstrap analysis we find that flares and star spots reduce the accuracy of transit parameters by up to 10\% in the planet-to-star radius ratio and the accuracy on transit time by 3-4 min. Nevertheless, occulted stellar spot features independently confirm the presence of transit timing variations (TTVs) with an amplitude of at least 4 min.

We present a combined analysis of both TESS Sector 1 and Sector 27 AU Mic light curves including the new 20 s cadence data from TESS Year 3. We compare flare rates between both observations and analyze the spot evolution, showing that the activity levels increase slightly from Sector 1 to Sector 27. Furthermore, the 20 s data collection allows us to detect more flares, smaller flares, and better resolve flare morphology in white light as compared to the 2 minute data collection mode. We also refine the parameters for AU Mic b by fitting three additional transits of AU Mic b from Sector 27 using a model that includes stellar activity. We show that the transits exhibit clear transit timing variations with an amplitude of {\textasciitilde}80 s. We also detect three transits of a 2.8 R ⊕ planet, AU Mic c, which has a period of 18.86 days.},

	abstract = {Biosignature gas detection is one of the ultimate future goals for exoplanet atmosphere studies. We have created a framework for linking biosignature gas detectability to biomass estimates, including atmospheric photochemistry and biological thermodynamics. The new framework is intended to liberate predictive atmosphere models from requiring fixed, Earth-like biosignature gas source fluxes. New biosignature gases can be considered with a check that the biomass estimate is physically plausible. We have validated the models on terrestrial production of NO, H2S, CH4, CH3Cl, and DMS. We have applied the models to propose NH3 as a biosignature gas on a "cold Haber World," a planet with a N2-H2 atmosphere, and to demonstrate why gases such as CH3Cl must have too large of a biomass to be a plausible biosignature gas on planets with Earth or early-Earth-like atmospheres orbiting a Sun-like star. To construct the biomass models, we developed a functional classification of biosignature gases, and found that gases (such as CH4, H2S, and N2O) produced from life that extracts energy from chemical potential energy gradients will always have false positives because geochemistry has the same gases to work with as life does, and gases (such as DMS and CH3Cl) produced for secondary metabolic reasons are far less likely to have false positives but because of their highly specialized origin are more likely to be produced in small quantities. The biomass model estimates are valid to one or two orders of magnitude; the goal is an independent approach to testing whether a biosignature gas is plausible rather than a precise quantification of atmospheric biosignature gases and their corresponding biomasses.},

	abstract = {Super-Earth exoplanets are being discovered with increasing frequency and some will be able to retain stable H2-dominated atmospheres. We study biosignature gases on exoplanets with thin H2 atmospheres and habitable surface temperatures, using a model atmosphere with photochemistry and a biomass estimate framework for evaluating the plausibility of a range of biosignature gas candidates. We find that photochemically produced H atoms are the most abundant reactive species in H2 atmospheres. In atmospheres with high CO2 levels, atomic O is the major destructive species for some molecules. In Sun-Earth-like UV radiation environments, H (and in some cases O) will rapidly destroy nearly all biosignature gases of interest. The lower UV fluxes from UV-quiet M stars would produce a lower concentration of H (or O) for the same scenario, enabling some biosignature gases to accumulate. The favorability of low-UV radiation environments to accumulate detectable biosignature gases in an H2 atmosphere is closely analogous to the case of oxidized atmospheres, where photochemically produced OH is the major destructive species. Most potential biosignature gases, such as dimethylsulfide and CH3Cl, are therefore more favorable in low-UV, as compared with solar-like UV, environments. A few promising biosignature gas candidates, including NH3 and N2O, are favorable even in solar-like UV environments, as these gases are destroyed directly by photolysis and not by H (or O). A more subtle finding is that most gases produced by life that are fully hydrogenated forms of an element, such as CH4 and H2S, are not effective signs of life in an H2-rich atmosphere because the dominant atmospheric chemistry will generate such gases abiologically, through photochemistry or geochemistry. Suitable biosignature gases in H2-rich atmospheres for super-Earth exoplanets transiting M stars could potentially be detected in transmission spectra with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

	abstract = {V2487 Oph is a recurrent nova with detected eruptions in 1900 and 1998. Startlingly, V2487 Oph shows flares, called 'Superflares', with up to 1.10 mag amplitude, fast rises of under one-minute, always with an initial impulsive spike followed by a roughly-exponential tail, typically one-hour durations, and with random event times averaging once-per-day. The typical flare energy E is over 1038 ergs, while the yearly energy budget is 1041 ergs. V2487 Oph Superflares obey three relations; the number distribution of flare energies scales as E-2.34 ± 0.35, the waiting time from one flare to the next is proportional to E of the first event, and flare durations scale as E0.44 ± 0.03. Scenarios involving gravitational energy and nuclear energy fail to satisfy the three relations. The magnetic energy scenario, however, can explain all three relations. This scenario has magnetic field lines above the disc being twisted and amplified by the motions of their footprints, with magnetic reconnection releasing energy that comes out as Superflare light. This exact mechanism is already well known to occur in white light solar flares, in ordinary M-type flare stars, and in the many Superflare stars observed all across the H-R diagram. Superflares on Superflare stars have rise times, light curve shapes and durations that are very similar to those on V2487 Oph. So we conclude that the V2487 Oph Superflares are caused by large-scale magnetic reconnection. V2487 Oph is now the most extreme Superflare star, exhibiting the largest known flare energy (1.6 × 1039 ergs) and the fastest occurrence rate.},

Twelve flares are detected in total, including ten Hα, four X-ray, and four optical-continuum flares; one of them is a superflare with a total energy of ∼2.0 × 1033 erg. We found that: (1) during the superflare, the Hα emission line full width at 1/8 maximum dramatically increases to 14 Å from 8 Å in the low-resolution spectra (R ∼ 2000) accompanied by large white-light flares, (2) some weak Hα/X-ray flares are not accompanied by white-light emissions, and (3) the non-flaring emissions show clear rotational modulations in X-ray and Hα intensity in the same phase. To understand these observational features, one-dimensional hydrodynamic flare simulations are performed using the RADYN code. We find the simulated Hα line profiles with hard and high-energy non-thermal electron beams to be consistent with the initial phase line profiles of the superflares, while those with a softer and/or weak-energy beam are consistent with those in decay phases, indicating the changes in the energy fluxes injected to the lower atmosphere. Also, we find that the relation between the optical continuum and Hα intensity is nonlinear, which can be one cause of the non-white-light flares. The flare energy budget exhibits diversity in the observations and models, and more observations of stellar flares are necessary for constraining the occurrence of various emission line phenomena in stellar flares.},

Subsequent spacecraft investigations have revealed that many of the planets - and even some moons - either currently have or have had in the past a planetaryscale magnetic field. Generated by dynamo processes within the planet, planetary-scale magnetic fields provide a means of constraining the properties of a planet's interior through remote sensing, and it may even be possible to measure the magnetic fields of extrasolar planets. If so, they will offer one of the few means available of understanding the potential diversity of planetary interiors. In the case of our own planet, the presence of Earth's magnetic field has long been suspected to be partially responsible for its habitability. Thus, knowledge of the magnetic field of an extrasolar planet may be a valuable component to assess its habitability, or to understand an absence of life on an otherwise potentially habitable planet.},

	abstract = {A small percentage of normal stars harbor giant planets that orbit within a few tenths of an astronomical unit. At such distances, the potential exists for significant tidal and magnetic field interaction resulting in energy dissipation that may manifest as changes within the stellar corona. We examine the X-ray emission of stars hosting planets and find a positive correlation between X-ray luminosity and the projected mass of the most closely orbiting exoplanets. We investigate possible systematics and observational biases that could mimic or confuse this correlation but find no strong evidence for any, especially for planets more massive than ∼0.1 MJ. Luminosities and upper limits are consistent with the interpretation that there is a lower floor to stellar X-ray emission dependent on close-in planetary mass. Under the hypothesis that this is a consequence of planet–star magnetic field interaction, and energy dissipation, we estimate a possible field strength increase of a factor of ∼8 between planets of 1 and 10 MJ. Intriguingly, this is consistent with recent geodynamo scaling law predictions. The high-energy photon emission of planet–star systems may therefore provide unique access to the detailed magnetic, and hence geodynamic, properties of exoplanets.},

The mechanism by which a magnetic field is created is examined. The effects of rotation and magnetic field on the convection are of paramount importance in the simulations. A wide range of simulations with different convection models, varying boundary conditions, and parameter values have been performed over the past 10 years. The effects of these differences are assessed. Numerical considerations mean that all dynamo simulations use much enhanced values of the diffusivities.

Our simulation reveals a highly structured stellar corona characterized by sectors with different plasma properties. The star-planet interaction (SPI) varies in magnitude and complexity, depending on the planetary phase, planetary magnetic field strength, and the relative orientation of the stellar and planetary fields. It also reveals a long, comet-like tail which is a result of the wrapping of the planetary magnetospheric tail by its fast orbital motion. A reconnection event occurs at a specific orbital phase, causing mass loss from the planetary magnetosphere that can generate a hot spot on the stellar surface. The simulation also shows that the system has sufficient energy to produce hot spots observed in Ca II lines in giant planet hosting stars.

A total of 10 of the 13 targets have close planetary companions. All of the stars observed at the CFHT show long-term (months to years) changes in H and K intensity levels. Four stars display short-term (days) cyclical activity. For two, HD 73256 and κ1 Cet, the activity is likely associated with an active region rotating with the star; however, the flaring in excess of the rotational modulation may be associated with a hot Jupiter. A planetary companion remains a possibility for κ1 Cet. For the other two, HD 179949 and υ And, the cyclic variation is synchronized to the hot Jupiter's orbit. For both stars this synchronicity with the orbit is clearly seen in two out of three epochs. The effect is only marginal in the third epoch at which the seasonal level of chromospheric activity had changed for both stars. Short-term chromospheric activity appears weakly dependent on the mean K line reversal intensities for the sample of 13 stars. In addition, a suggestive correlation exists between this activity and the Mpsini of the star's hot Jupiter. Because of their small separation ({\textless}=0.1 AU), many of the hot Jupiters lie within the Alfvén radius of their host stars, which allows a direct magnetic interaction with the stellar surface. We discuss the conditions under which a planet's magnetic field might induce activity on the stellar surface and why no such effect was seen for the prime candidate, τ Boo. This work opens up the possibility of characterizing planet-star interactions, with implications for extrasolar planet magnetic fields and the energy contribution to stellar atmospheres.

In the case of a non-axisymmetric field, the time modulation of the energy release is multiperiodic and can be easily confused with the intrinsic stellar variability. We apply our theory to the systems with some reported evidence of star-planet magnetic interaction finding a dissipated power at least one order of magnitude smaller than that emitted by the chromospheric hot spots. The phase lags between the planets and the hot spots are reproduced by our models in all the cases except for υ And. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The chromospheric hot spots rotating in phase with the planets cannot be explained by the energy dissipation produced by the interaction between stellar and planetary fields as considered by our models and require a different mechanism.},

	abstract = {The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) was selected on October 19, 2012, as the first small mission (S-mission) in the ESA Science Programme and successfully launched on December 18, 2019, as a secondary passenger on a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. CHEOPS is a partnership between ESA and Switzerland with important contributions by ten additional ESA Member States. CHEOPS is the first mission dedicated to search for transits of exoplanets using ultrahigh precision photometry on bright stars already known to host planets. As a follow-up mission, CHEOPS is mainly dedicated to improving, whenever possible, existing radii measurements or provide first accurate measurements for a subset of those planets for which the mass has already been estimated from ground-based spectroscopic surveys. The expected photometric precision will also allow CHEOPS to go beyond measuring only transits and to follow phase curves or to search for exo-moons, for example. Finally, by unveiling transiting exoplanets with high potential for in-depth characterisation, CHEOPS will also provide prime targets for future instruments suited to the spectroscopic characterisation of exoplanetary atmospheres. To reach its science objectives, requirements on the photometric precision and stability have been derived for stars with magnitudes ranging from 6 to 12 in the V band. In particular, CHEOPS shall be able to detect Earth-size planets transiting G5 dwarf stars (stellar radius of 0.9R⊙) in the magnitude range 6 ≤ V ≤ 9 by achieving a photometric precision of 20 ppm in 6 hours of integration time. In the case of K-type stars (stellar radius of 0.7R⊙) of magnitude in the range 9 ≤ V ≤ 12, CHEOPS shall be able to detect transiting Neptune-size planets achieving a photometric precision of 85 ppm in 3 hours of integration time. This precision has to be maintained over continuous periods of observation for up to 48 hours. This precision and stability will be achieved by using a single, frame-transfer, back-illuminated CCD detector at the focal plane assembly of a 33.5 cm diameter, on-axis Ritchey-Chrétien telescope. The nearly 275 kg spacecraft is nadir-locked, with a pointing accuracy of about 1 arcsec rms, and will allow for at least 1 Gbit/day downlink. The sun-synchronous dusk-dawn orbit at 700 km altitude enables having the Sun permanently on the backside of the spacecraft thus minimising Earth stray light. A mission duration of 3.5 years in orbit is foreseen to enable the execution of the science programme. During this period, 20\% of the observing time is available to the wider community through yearly ESA call for proposals, as well as through discretionary time approved by ESA's Director of Science. At the time of this writing, CHEOPS commissioning has been completed and CHEOPS has been shown to fulfill all its requirements. The mission has now started the execution of its science programme.},

	abstract = {Context. The discovery of moderate differential rotation between the core and the envelope of evolved solar-like stars could be the signature of a strong magnetic field trapped inside the radiative interior. The population of intermediate-mass red giants presenting surprisingly low-amplitude mixed modes (i.e. oscillation modes that behave as acoustic modes in their external envelope and as gravity modes in their core) could also arise from the effect of an internal magnetic field. Indeed, stars more massive than about 1.1 solar masses are known to develop a convective core during their main sequence. The field generated by the dynamo triggered by this convection could be the progenitor of a strong fossil magnetic field trapped inside the core of the star for the remainder of its evolution. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: Observations of mixed modes can constitute an excellent probe of the deepest layers of evolved solar-like stars, and magnetic fields in those regions can impact their propagation. The magnetic perturbation on mixed modes may therefore be visible in asteroseismic data. To unravel which constraints can be obtained from observations, we theoretically investigate the effects of a plausible mixed axisymmetric magnetic field with various amplitudes on the mixed-mode frequencies of evolved solar-like stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: First-order frequency perturbations due to an axisymmetric magnetic field were computed for dipolar and quadrupolar mixed modes. These computations were carried out for a range of stellar ages, masses, and metallicities. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We show that typical fossil-field strengths of 0.1 − 1 MG, consistent with the presence of a dynamo in the convective core during the main sequence, provoke significant asymmetries on mixed-mode frequency multiplets during the red giant branch. We provide constraints and methods for the detectability of such magnetic signatures. We show that these signatures may be detectable in asteroseismic data for field amplitudes small enough for the amplitude of the modes not to be affected by the conversion of gravity into Alfvén waves inside the magnetised interior. Finally, we infer an upper limit for the strength of the field and the associated lower limit for the timescale of its action in order to redistribute angular momentum in stellar interiors.},

	abstract = {We present a nonlinear analytical model of the Alfvén current tubes continuing the currents through Io (or rather its ionosphere) generated by the unipolar inductor effect due to Io's motion relative to the magnetospheric plasma. We thereby extend the linear work by Drell et al. (1965) to the fully nonlinear, sub-Alfvénic situation also including flow which is not perpendicular to the background magnetic field. The following principal results have been obtained: (1) The portion of the currents feeding Io is aligned with the Alfvén characteristics at an angle θA = tan−1 MA to the magnetic field for the special case of perpendicular flow where MA is the Alfvén Mach number. (2) The Alfvén tubes act like an external conductance ΣA = 1/(µ0VA(1 + MA² + 2MA sin θ)1/2) where VA is the Alfvén speed and θ the angular deviation from perpendicular flow towards the direction of Alfvén wave propagation. Hence the Jovian ionospheric conductivity is not necessary for current closure. (3) In addition, the Alfvén tubes may be reflected from either the torus boundary or the Jovian ionosphere. The efficiency of the resulting interaction with these boundaries varies with Io position. The interaction is particularly strong at extreme magnetic latitudes, thereby suggesting a mechanism for the Io control of decametric emissions. (4) The reflected Alfvén waves may heat both the torus plasma and the Jovian ionosphere as well as produce increased diffusion of high-energy particles in the torus. (5) From the point of view of the electrodynamic interaction, Io is unique among the Jovian satellites for several reasons: these include its ionosphere arising from ionized volcanic gases, a high external Alfvénic conductance ΣA, and a high corotational voltage in addition to the interaction phenomenon with a boundary. (6) We find that Amalthea is probably strongly coupled to Jupiter's ionosphere while the outer Galilean satellites may occasionally experience super-Alfvénic conditions.},

The data have been analysed using spot modelling and temporal mapping methods we have used for other Kepler host stars, and a search for flares was conducted. Our results indicate a low-latitude region of the photosphere marked by distinct areas of individual or grouped star-spots with moderately high solar-type differential rotation of 0.102 ± 0.011 rad d-1, but with just two major flares observed across 400 d. These results imply a rotational shear significantly greater than that of our slower rotating Sun. The observed flares are more energetic than typical solar flares, but similar to those of other magnetically active cool dwarfs.},

We present a self-consistent three-dimensional model of magnetic field generation in low-mass FC stars. The model utilizes the anelastic magnetohydrodynamic equations to simulate compressible convection in a rotating sphere. A distributed dynamo working in the model spontaneously produces a dipole-dominated surface magnetic field of the observed strength. The interaction of this field with the turbulent convection in outer layers shreds it, producing small-scale fields that carry most of the magnetic flux. The Zeeman-Doppler-Imaging technique applied to synthetic spectropolarimetric data based on our model recovers most of the large-scale field. Our model simultaneously reproduces the morphology and magnitude of the large-scale field as well as the magnitude of the small-scale field observed on low-mass FC stars.},

	abstract = {The relatively high contrast between planetary and solar low-frequency radio emissions suggests that the low-frequency radio range may be well adapted to the direct detection of exoplanets. We review the most significant properties of planetary radio emissions (auroral as well as satellite induced) and show that their primary engine is the interaction of a plasma flow with an obstacle in the presence of a strong magnetic field (of the flow or of the obstacle). Scaling laws have been derived from solar system planetary radio emissions that relate the emitted radio power to the power dissipated in the various corresponding flow-obstacle interactions. We generalize these scaling laws into a "radio-magnetic" scaling law that seems to relate output radio power to the magnetic energy flux convected on the obstacle, this obstacle being magnetized or unmagnetized. Extrapolating this scaling law to the case of exoplanets, we find that hot Jupiters may produce very intense radio emissions due to either magnetospheric interaction with a strong stellar wind or to unipolar interaction between the planet and a magnetic star (or strongly magnetized regions of the stellar surface). In the former case, similar to the magnetosphere-solar wind interactions in our solar system or to the Ganymede-Jupiter interaction, a hecto-decameter emission is expected in the vicinity of the planet with an intensity possibly 10 {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}-10 {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}5{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} times that of Jupiter's low frequency radio emissions. In the latter case, which is a giant analogy of the Io-Jupiter system, emission in the decameter-to-meter wavelength range near the footprints of the star's magnetic field lines interacting with the planet may reach 10 {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}6{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} times that of Jupiter (unless some "saturation" mechanism occurs). The system of HD179949, where a hot spot has been tentatively detected in visible light near the sub-planetary point, is discussed in some details. Radio detectability is addressed with present and future low-frequency radiotelescopes. Finally, we discuss the interests of direct radio detection, among which access to exoplanetary magnetic field measurements and comparative magnetospheric physics.},

Extensive tests of the Taylor-Joner photometry and other pertinent results are therefore performed in this paper. It is found that in part, the Pinsonneault et al. conclusion rests on (1) a systematic error in Mendoza's (R-I)J photometry and (2) a small error in an approximate Johnson-to-Cousins transformation published by Bessell. For the Taylor-Joner values of (V-R)C, it is found that there are possible (though not definite) differences of several mmag with other results. However, the Taylor-Joner values of (R-I)C data are supported at the 1 mmag level. Using the (R-I)C data and other published results, an (R-I)C catalog is assembled for 146 Hyades stars with spectral types earlier than about K5. For single stars with multiple contributing data, the rms errors of the catalog entries are less than 4.4 mmag. Temperatures on the Di Benedetto angular-diameter scale are also given in the catalog and are used to help update published analyses of high-dispersion values of [Fe/H] for the Hyades. The best current mean Hyades value of [Fe/H] is found to be +0.103+/-0.008 dex and is essentially unchanged from its previous value.

Low-resolution (R{\textasciitilde}150) 0.8-2.5 μm spectroscopy obtained with the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) SpeX instrument reveals the characteristic H2O and CH4 bands in the spectra of these brown dwarfs. Comparison with spectral standards observed with the same instrument enables us to derive classifications of T3 to T7 for the objects in this sample. Moderate-resolution (R{\textasciitilde}1200) near-infrared spectroscopy for a subset of these discoveries reveal K I line strengths consistent with previously observed trends with spectral type. Follow-up imaging observations provide proper-motion measurements for these sources, ranging from less than 0.1" to 1.55" yr-1. One object, 2MASS 0034+0523, has a spectrophotometric distance placing it within 10 pc of the Sun. This source also exhibits a depressed K-band peak reminiscent of the peculiar T dwarf 2MASS 0937+2931 and may be a metal-poor or old, high-mass brown dwarf. We also present low-resolution SpeX data for a set of M- and L-type dwarf, subdwarf, and giant comparison stars used to classify 59 additional candidates identified as background stars. These are primarily M5-M8.5 dwarfs, many exhibiting H I Paγ, but include three candidate ultracool M subdwarfs and one possible early-type L subdwarf.},

The goal of this work is a determination of the low-mass star and brown dwarf luminosity function in the infrared.

In addition, we have identified 10 M4-M6.5 objects that are likely to be within 20 pc (or within 1 σ).

	abstract = {While the strong anticorrelation between chromospheric activity and age has led to the common use of the Ca II H and K emission index (R'HK = LHK/Lbol) as an empirical age estimator for solar-type dwarfs, existing activity-age relations produce implausible ages at both high and low activity levels. We have compiled R'HK data from the literature for young stellar clusters, richly populating for the first time the young end of the activity-age relation. Combining the cluster activity data with modern cluster age estimates and analyzing the color dependence of the chromospheric activity age index, we derive an improved activity-age calibration for F7-K2 dwarfs (0.5 mag {\textless} B - V {\textless} 0.9 mag ). We also present a more fundamentally motivated activity-age calibration that relies on conversion of R'HK values through the Rossby number to rotation periods and then makes use of improved gyrochronology relations. We demonstrate that our new activity-age calibration has typical age precision of {\textasciitilde}0.2 dex for normal solar-type dwarfs aged between the Hyades and the Sun ({\textasciitilde}0.6-4.5 Gyr). Inferring ages through activity-rotation-age relations accounts for some color-dependent effects and systematically improves the age estimates (albeit only slightly). We demonstrate that coronal activity as measured through the fractional X-ray luminosity (RX = LX/Lbol) has nearly the same age- and rotation-inferring capability as chromospheric activity measured through R'HK. As a first application of our calibrations, we provide new activity-derived age estimates for a volume-limited sample of the 108 solar-type field dwarfs within 16 pc.},

	abstract = {I present radio observations of 90 dwarf stars and brown dwarfs of spectral type M5-T8. Three sources exhibit radio activity, in addition to the six objects previously detected in quiescence and outburst, leading to an overall detection rate of {\textasciitilde}10\% for objects later than M7. The inferred magnetic field strengths are {\textasciitilde}102 G in quiescence and nearly 1 kG during flares, while the majority of the nondetected objects have B{\textless}{\textasciitilde}50 G. Depending on the configuration and size of the magnetic loops, the surface fields may approach 1 kG even in quiescence, at most a factor of a few smaller than in early M dwarfs. With the larger sample of sources I find continued evidence for (1) a sharp transition around spectral type of M7 from a ratio of radio to X-ray luminosity of log(LR/LX){\textasciitilde}-15.5 to {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}-12, (2) increased radio activity (LR/Lbol) with later spectral type, in contrast to Hα and X-ray observations, and (3) an overall drop in the fraction of active sources from {\textasciitilde}30\% for M dwarfs to {\textasciitilde}5\% for L dwarfs, consistent with Hα and X-ray observations. Taken together, these trends suggest that some late M and L dwarfs are capable of generating 0.1-1 kG magnetic fields, but the overall drop in the fraction of such objects likely reflects changes in the structure of the chromospheres and coronae, possibly due to increasingly neutral atmospheres and/or a transition to a turbulent dynamo. These possibilities can best be tested through simultaneous observations, which can trace the effect of magnetic dissipation in a direct, rather than a statistical, manner. Still, a more extended radio survey currently holds the best promise for measuring the magnetic field properties of a large number of dwarf stars.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a comprehensive assessment of companions to solar-type stars. A sample of 454 stars, including the Sun, was selected from the Hipparcos catalog with π{\textgreater}40 mas, σπ/π {\textless} 0.05, 0.5 {\textless}= B - V {\textless}= 1.0 ({\textasciitilde}F6-K3), and constrained by absolute magnitude and color to exclude evolved stars. These criteria are equivalent to selecting all dwarf and subdwarf stars within 25 pc with V-band flux between 0.1 and 10 times that of the Sun, giving us a physical basis for the term "solar-type." New observational aspects of this work include surveys for (1) very close companions with long-baseline interferometry at the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy Array, (2) close companions with speckle interferometry, and (3) wide proper-motion companions identified by blinking multi-epoch archival images. In addition, we include the results from extensive radial-velocity monitoring programs and evaluate companion information from various catalogs covering many different techniques. The results presented here include four new common proper-motion companions discovered by blinking archival images. Additionally, the spectroscopic data searched reveal five new stellar companions. Our synthesis of results from many methods and sources results in a thorough evaluation of stellar and brown dwarf companions to nearby Sun-like stars. The overall observed fractions of single, double, triple, and higher-order systems are 56\% ± 2\%, 33\% ± 2\%, 8\% ± 1\%, and 3\% ± 1\%, respectively, counting all confirmed stellar and brown dwarf companions. If all candidate, i.e., unconfirmed, companions identified are found to be real, the percentages would change to 54\% ± 2\%, 34\% ± 2\%, 9\% ± 2\%, and 3\% ± 1\%, respectively. Our completeness analysis indicates that only a few undiscovered companions remain in this well-studied sample, implying that the majority (54\% ± 2\%) of solar-type stars are single, in contrast to the results of prior multiplicity studies. Our sample is large enough to enable a check of the multiplicity dependence on various physical parameters by analyzing appropriate subsamples. Bluer, more massive stars are seen as more likely to have companions than redder, less massive ones, consistent with the trend seen over the entire spectral range. Systems with larger interaction cross sections, i.e., those with more than two components or long orbital periods, are preferentially younger, suggesting that companions may be stripped over time by dynamical interactions. We confirm the planet-metallicity correlation (i.e., higher metallicity stars are more likely to host planets), but are unable to check it for brown dwarfs due to the paucity of such companions, implying that the brown dwarf desert extends over all separation regimes. We find no correlation between stellar companions and metallicity for B - V {\textless} 0.625, but among the redder subset, metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] {\textless}-0.3) are more likely to have companions with a 2.4σ significance. The orbital-period distribution of companions is unimodal and roughly log normal with a peak and median of about 300 years. The period-eccentricity relation shows the expected circularization for periods below 12 days, caused by tidal forces over the age of the Galaxy, followed by a roughly flat distribution. The mass-ratio distribution shows a preference for like-mass pairs, which occur more frequently in relatively close pairs. The fraction of planet hosts among single, binary, and multiple systems are statistically indistinguishable, suggesting that planets are as likely to form around single stars as they are around components of binary or multiple systems with sufficiently wide separations. This, along with the preference of long orbital periods among stellar systems, increases the space around stars conducive for planet formation, and perhaps life.},

We also discuss the effect arising from various, slightly different response functions of the associated detector systems that were used to give SDSS photometry. We show that the calibration procedures of SDSS remove these variations reasonably well with the resulting final errors from variant response functions being unlikely to be larger than 0.01 mag for g, r, i, and z bands over the entire duration of the survey. The considerable aging effect is uncovered in the u band, the response function showing a 30\% decrease in the throughput in the short wavelength side during the survey years, which potentially causes a systematic error in photometry. The aging effect is consistent with variation of the instrumental sensitivity in the u band, which is calibrated out. The expected color variation is consistent with measured color variation in the catalog of repeated photometry. The color variation is Δ(u - g) {\textasciitilde} 0.01 for most stars, and at most Δ(u - g) {\textasciitilde} 0.02 mag for those with extreme colors. We verified in the final catalog that no systematic variations in excess of 0.01 mag are detected in the photometry which can be ascribed to aging and/or seasonal effects except for the secular u - g color variation for stars with extreme colors.},

We find best fits for Padova isochrones at age t = 2.5 ± 0.25 Gyr, m - M = 7.35 ± 0.1, and AV = 0.25 ± 0.05, with additional uncertainty from the unresolved binary population and possibility of differential extinction across this large cluster. The inferred age is heavily dependent on our choice of stellar evolution model: fitting Dartmouth and PARSEC models yield age parameters of 3 Gyr and 3.25 Gyr, respectively.

They also hold clues to the chemical and nucleosynthetic processes throughout the history of the Galaxy. We have taken high signal-to-noise (S/N), high-resolution spectra of 11 solar-type stars in the Praesepe open cluster to determine the chemical abundances of 16 elements: Li, C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ni, Y, and Ba. We have determined Fe from Fe I and Fe II lines and find [Fe/H] = +0.12 ±0.04. We find that Li decreases with temperature due to increasing Li depletion in cooler stars; it matches the Li-temperature pattern found in the Hyades. The [C/Fe] and [O/Fe] abundances are below solar and lower than the field star samples due to the younger age of Praesepe (0.7 Gyr) than the field stars. The alpha-elements, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, have solar ratios with respect to Fe, and are also lower than the field star samples. The Fe-peak elements, Cr and Ni, track Fe and have solar values. The neutron capture element [Y/Fe] is found to be solar, but [Ba/Fe] is enhanced relative to solar and to the field stars. Three Praesepe giants were studied by Carrera and Pancino; they are apparently enhanced in Na, Mg, and Ba relative to the Praesepe dwarfs. The Na enhancement may indicate proton-capture nucleosynthesis in the Ne → Na cycling with dredge-up into the atmospheres of the red giants.},

This event occurred near the solar limb, and so differences in the locations of the various emissions are consistent with differences in heights above the photosphere of the various emission sources. Under this interpretation, our observations are consistent with the white-light emissions occurring at the lowest levels of where the Ca II H emission occurs. Moreover, the centers of the source regions of the red, green, and blue wavelengths of the white-light emissions are significantly displaced from each other, suggesting that those respective emissions are emanating from progressively lower heights in the solar atmosphere. The temperature distribution was also calculated from the white-light data, and we found the lower-layer emission to have a higher temperature. This indicates that high-energy particles penetrated down to near the photosphere, and deposited heat into the ambient lower layers of the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {The relationship between age, rotation, and magnetic activity can be used to roughly estimate the ages of solar-type stars. At lower stellar masses, the relationship between activity and age changes due to the less efficient angular momentum loss, and may disappear entirely for ultracool (late-M and L) dwarfs. The detection of flares (as a tracer of magnetic activity) can be combined with kinematic tracers of age to explore the relationship between age and activity for ultracool dwarfs. The final data release of Gaia will provide time-resolved photometry of Gaia targets in the G filter, but the effect of flares in the G-band is not well understood. I use a simple flare model to estimate the conversion of flare magnitudes for M3-L5 dwarfs in the Johnson V-, SDSS r-, and Kepler- bands to the Gaia G-band. By applying those conversions to previously observed flare rates, I estimate that M0-M6 dwarfs will have a flare rate in Gaia of Rf,Gaia gtrsim 8.73 × 10-4 hr-1 deg-2, corresponding to a total of gtrsim 20,000 flares in the whole survey. If ultracool dwarfs have the same flare rate, I would expect a total of gtrsim 20 flares on M7-L5 dwarfs.},

Our automated autocorrelation-based method detected rotation periods between 0.2 and 70 days for 34,030 (25.6\%) of the 133,030 main-sequence Kepler targets (excluding known eclipsing binaries and Kepler Objects of Interest), making this the largest sample of stellar rotation periods to date. In this paper we consider the detailed features of the now well-populated period-temperature distribution and demonstrate that the period bimodality, first seen by McQuillan et al. in the M-dwarf sample, persists to higher masses, becoming less visible above 0.6 M ⊙. We show that these results are globally consistent with the existing ground-based rotation-period data and find that the upper envelope of the period distribution is broadly consistent with a gyrochronological age of 4.5 Gyr, based on the isochrones of Barnes, Mamajek, \& Hillenbrand and Meibom et al. We also performed a detailed comparison of our results to those of Reinhold et al. and Nielsen et al., who measured rotation periods of field stars observed by Kepler. We examined the amplitude of periodic variability for the stars with detection rotation periods, and found a typical range between {\textasciitilde}950 ppm (5th percentile) and {\textasciitilde}22,700 ppm (95th percentile), with a median of {\textasciitilde}5600 ppm. We found typically higher amplitudes for shorter periods and lower effective temperatures, with an excess of low-amplitude stars above {\textasciitilde}5400 K.},

However, optical emission is a significant contribution to flare energy budgets and the emission mechanisms responsible could have important implications for flare models. Using Hinode SOT optical continuum data taken in broadband red, green, and blue filters, we investigate WL emission from the X2.2 flare SOL2011-02-15T01:56:00. We develop a technique to robustly identify enhanced flare pixels and, using a knowledge of the RGB filter transmissions, determined the source color temperature and effective temperature. We investigated two idealized models of WL emission—an optically thick photospheric source, and an optically thin chromospheric slab. Under the optically thick assumption, the color temperature and effective temperature of flare sources in sunspot umbra and penumbra were determined as a function of time and position. Values in the range of 5000-6000 K were found, corresponding to a blackbody temperature increase of a few hundred kelvin. The power emitted in the optical was estimated at {\textasciitilde}1026 erg s-1. In some of the WL sources the color and blackbody temperatures are the same within uncertainties, consistent with a blackbody emitter. In other regions this is not the case, suggesting that some other continuum emission process is contributing. An optically thin slab model producing hydrogen recombination radiation is also discussed as a potential source of WL emission; it requires temperatures in the range 5500-25,000 K, and total energies of {\textasciitilde}1027 erg s-1.},

Jansky Very Large Array and Gemini North Telescope reveal that the L dwarf is magnetically active, with quiescent radio and variable Hα emission. A preliminary trigonometric parallax shows that W1906+40 is at a distance of 16.35{\textasciicircum}\{+0.36\}\_\{-0.34\} pc, and all observations are consistent with W1906+40 being an old disk star just above the hydrogen-burning limit.

We infer a radius of 0.92 ± 0.07RJ and sin i {\textgreater} 0.57 from the observed period, luminosity (10-3.67 ± 0.03 L ⊙), effective temperature (2300 ± 75 K), and vsin i (11.2 ± 2.2 km s-1).

Unlike many L-type brown dwarfs, there is no evidence of other variations at the {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 2\% level, either non-periodic or transient periodic, that mask the underlying rotation period. We suggest that the long-lived surface features may be due to starspots, but the possibility of cloud variations cannot be ruled out without further multi-wavelength observations. During the Gemini spectroscopy, we observed the most powerful flare ever seen on an L dwarf, with an estimated energy of {\textasciitilde}1.6 × 1032 erg in white light emission.

The γ values of eight stars with frequent flaring activity vary between 1.59 ± 0.06 and 2.11 ± 0.19, suggesting a possible diversity of energy release effects. In general, stars with shorter rotation periods tend to have larger γ values. There is an indication that the flare energy is saturated at about 2 × 1037 erg.

The loss of two of these reaction wheels reduced the telescope's ability to point precisely for extended periods of time, and as a result, the photometric precision has suffered. We present a technique for generating photometric light curves from pixel-level data obtained with the two-wheeled extended Kepler mission, K2. Our photometric technique accounts for the non-uniform pixel response function of the Kepler detectors by correlating flux measurements with the spacecraft's pointing and removing the dependence. When we apply our technique to the ensemble of stars observed during the Kepler Two-Wheel Concept Engineering Test, we find improvements over raw K2 photometry by factors of 2-5, with noise properties qualitatively similar to Kepler targets at the same magnitudes. We find evidence that the improvement in photometric precision depends on each target's position in the Kepler field of view, with worst precision near the edges of the field. Overall, this technique restores the median attainable photometric precision to within a factor of two of the original Kepler photometric precision for targets ranging from 10\${\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$ to 15\${\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$ magnitude in the Kepler bandpass, peaking with a median precision within 35\% that of Kepler for stars between 12\${\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$ and 13\${\textasciicircum}\{th\}\$ magnitude in the Kepler bandpass.},

	abstract = {After the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae discovered a significant brightening of the inner region of NGC 2617, we began a {\textasciitilde}70 day photometric and spectroscopic monitoring campaign from the X-ray through near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. We report that NGC 2617 went through a dramatic outburst, during which its X-ray flux increased by over an order of magnitude followed by an increase of its optical/ultraviolet (UV) continuum flux by almost an order of magnitude. NGC 2617, classified as a Seyfert 1.8 galaxy in 2003, is now a Seyfert 1 due to the appearance of broad optical emission lines and a continuum blue bump. Such "changing look active galactic nuclei (AGNs)" are rare and provide us with important insights about AGN physics. Based on the Hβ line width and the radius-luminosity relation, we estimate the mass of central black hole (BH) to be (4 ± 1) × 107 M ⊙. When we cross-correlate the light curves, we find that the disk emission lags the X-rays, with the lag becoming longer as we move from the UV (2-3 days) to the NIR (6-9 days). Also, the NIR is more heavily temporally smoothed than the UV. This can largely be explained by a simple model of a thermally emitting thin disk around a BH of the estimated mass that is illuminated by the observed, variable X-ray fluxes.},

We present an absolute trigonometric parallax distance measurement to the Pleiades cluster that uses very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI). This distance of 136.2 ± 1.2 pc is the most accurate and precise yet presented for the cluster and is incompatible with the Hipparcos distance determination.

	abstract = {Using spectroscopic observations and photometric light curves of 238 nearby M dwarfs from the MEarth exoplanet transit survey, we examine the relationships between magnetic activity (quantified by Hα emission), rotation period, and stellar age. Previous attempts to investigate the relationship between magnetic activity and rotation in these stars were hampered by the limited number of M dwarfs with measured rotation periods (and the fact that v sin i measurements probe only rapid rotation). However, the photometric data from MEarth allows us to probe a wide range of rotation periods for hundreds of M dwarf stars (from shorter than one to longer than 100 days). Over all M spectral types that we probe, we find that the presence of magnetic activity is tied to rotation, including for late-type, fully convective M dwarfs. We also find evidence that the fraction of late-type M dwarfs that are active may be higher at longer rotation periods compared to their early-type counterparts, with several active, late-type, slowly rotating stars present in our sample. Additionally, we find that all M dwarfs with rotation periods shorter than 26 days (early-type; M1-M4) and 86 days (late-type; M5-M8) are magnetically active. This potential mismatch suggests that the physical mechanisms that connect stellar rotation to chromospheric heating may be different in fully convective stars. A kinematic analysis suggests that the magnetically active, rapidly rotating stars are consistent with a kinematically young population, while slow-rotators are less active or inactive and appear to belong to an older, dynamically heated stellar population.},

This will bring new opportunities and challenges, in particular the presence of a large number of main-belt asteroids that will contaminate the photometry. The large pixel size makes K2 data susceptible to the effects of apparent minor planet encounters. Here, we investigate the effects of asteroid encounters on photometric precision using a subsample of the K2 engineering data taken in 2014 February. We show examples of asteroid contamination to facilitate their recognition and distinguish these events from other error sources. We conclude that main-belt asteroids will have considerable effects on K2 photometry of a large number of photometric targets during the Mission that will have to be taken into account. These results will be readily applicable for future space photometric missions applying large-format CCDs, such as TESS and PLATO.},

We combine previous samples of SDSS M and L dwarfs with new data obtained from the Baryon Oscillation Sky Survey (BOSS) to produce the BOSS Ultracool Dwarf (BUD) sample of 11820 M7-L8 dwarfs. By combining SDSS data with photometry from 2MASS and the Wide-field Infrared Sky Explorer (WISE) mission, we present ultracool dwarf colors from i-z to W2-W3 as a function of spectral type, and extend the SDSS-2MASS-WISE color locus to include ultracool dwarfs. The i-z, i-J, and z-J colors provide the best indication of spectral type for M7-L3 dwarfs. We also examine ultracool dwarf chromospheric activity through the presence and strength of Hα emission. The fraction of active dwarfs rises through the M spectral sequence until it reaches ∼90\% at spectral type L0. The fraction of active dwarfs then declines to 50\% at spectral type L5; no Hα emission is observed in the late-L dwarfs in the BUD sample. The fraction of active L0-L5 dwarfs is much higher than previously observed. The strength of activity declines with spectral type from M7 through L3, after which the data do not show a clear trend. Using one-dimensional chromosphere models, we explore the range of filling factors and chromospheric temperature structures that are consistent with Hα observations of M0-L7 dwarfs. M dwarf chromospheres have a similar, smoothly varying range of temperature and surface coverage, while L dwarf chromospheres are cooler and have smaller filling factors.},

	abstract = {Precise and accurate parameters for late-type (late K and M) dwarf stars are important for characterization of any orbiting planets, but such determinations have been hampered by these stars’ complex spectra and dissimilarity to the Sun. We exploit an empirically calibrated method to estimate spectroscopic effective temperature (Teff) and the Stefan-Boltzmann law to determine radii of 183 nearby K7-M7 single stars with a precision of 2\%-5\%. Our improved stellar parameters enable us to develop model-independent relations between Teff or absolute magnitude and radius, as well as between color and Teff. The derived Teff-radius relation depends strongly on [Fe/H], as predicted by theory. The relation between absolute KS magnitude and radius can predict radii accurate to ≃ 3\%. We derive bolometric corrections to the V\{\{R\}C\}\{\{I\}C\}grizJH\{\{K\}S\} and Gaia passbands as a function of color, accurate to 1\%-3\%. We confront the reliability of predictions from Dartmouth stellar evolution models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo to find the values of unobservable model parameters (mass, age) that best reproduce the observed effective temperature and bolometric flux while satisfying constraints on distance and metallicity as Bayesian priors. With the inferred masses we derive a semi-empirical mass-absolute magnitude relation with a scatter of 2\% in mass. The best-agreement models overpredict stellar Teff values by an average of 2.2\% and underpredict stellar radii by 4.6\%, similar to differences with values from low-mass eclipsing binaries. These differences are not correlated with metallicity, mass, or indicators of activity, suggesting issues with the underlying model assumptions, e.g., opacities or convective mixing length.},

In this article we discuss the scientific motivation for these telescopes, including exoplanets, stellar variability and extragalactic transients. To provide a concrete example we detail the goals and expectations for the Evryscope, an under-construction 780 MPix telescope which covers 8,660 square degrees in each two-minute exposure; each night, 18,400 square degrees will be continuously observed for an average of approximately 6 hours. Despite its small 61mm aperture, the system's large field of view provides an etendue which is {\textasciitilde}10\% of LSST. The Evryscope, which places 27 separate individual telescopes into a common mount which tracks the entire accessible sky with only one moving part, will return 1\%-precision, many-year-length, high-cadence light curves for every accessible star brighter than mV=16.5, with brighter stars having few-millimagnitude photometric precision in long-term light curves. It will be capable of searching for transiting giant planets around the brightest and most nearby stars, where the planets are much easier to characterize; it will also search for small planets nearby M-dwarfs, for planetary occultations of white dwarfs, and will perform comprehensive nearby microlensing and eclipse-timing searches for exoplanets inaccessible to other planet-finding methods. The Evryscope will also monitor outbursting young stars, white dwarf activity, and stellar activity of all types, along with finding a large sample of very-long-period M-dwarf eclipsing binaries. When relatively rare transients events occur, such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), nearby supernovae, or even gravitational wave detections, the array will return minute-by-minute light curves without needing pointing towards the event as it occurs.

The brown dwarf candidates range in spectral type from M6 to M7, implying effective temperatures between ∼2800 and 2650 K. All sources exhibit Hα emission, consistent with enhanced chromospheric activity that is expected for young, very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. Li i λ6708 absorption is confidently detected in the photospheres of two of the seven sources. A revised lithium depletion boundary is established in the near-infrared where the effects of extinction and variability are minimized. This lithium depletion edge occurs near Ko = 14.45 or MK = 8.78 mag (UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey), assuming the most accurate and precise distance estimate for the cluster of 136.2 pc. From recent theoretical evolutionary models, a revised age of τ = 112 ± 5 Myr is determined for the Pleiades. Accounting for the effects of magnetic activity on the photospheres of these very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, however, would imply an even younger age for the cluster of ∼100 Myr.},

	abstract = {Power-law-like size distributions are ubiquitous in astrophysical instabilities. There are at least four natural effects that cause deviations from ideal power law size distributions, which we model here in a generalized way: (1) a physical threshold of an instability; (2) incomplete sampling of the smallest events below a threshold x0; (3) contamination by an event-unrelated background xb; and (4) truncation effects at the largest events due to a finite system size. These effects can be modeled in the simplest terms with a “thresholded power law” distribution function (also called generalized Pareto [type II] or Lomax distribution), N(x)\{dx\}{\textbackslash}propto \{(x+\{x\}0)\}-a\{dx\}, where x0 {\textgreater} 0 is positive for a threshold effect, while x0 {\textless} 0 is negative for background contamination. We analytically derive the functional shape of this thresholded power law distribution function from an exponential growth evolution model, which produces avalanches only when a disturbance exceeds a critical threshold x0. We apply the thresholded power law distribution function to terrestrial, solar (HXRBS, BATSE, RHESSI), and stellar flare (Kepler) data sets. We find that the thresholded power law model provides an adequate fit to most of the observed data. Major advantages of this model are the automated choice of the power law fitting range, diagnostics of background contamination, physical instability thresholds, instrumental detection thresholds, and finite system size limits. When testing self-organized criticality models that predict ideal power laws, we suggest including these natural truncation effects.},

We derived stellar parameters and differential chemical abundances for 19 elements (C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Ba) with uncertainties as low as ∼0.01-0.02 dex. Our main results include: (1) there is no clear chemical signature of planet formation detected among the sample stars, I.e. no correlations in abundances versus condensation temperature; (2) the observed abundance dispersions are a factor of ≈1.5-2 larger than the average measurement errors for most elements; (3) there are positive correlations, of high statistical significance, between the abundances of at least 90 per cent of pairs of elements. We demonstrate that none of these findings can be explained by errors due to the stellar parameters. Our results reveal that the Hyades is chemically inhomogeneous at the 0.02 dex level. Possible explanations for the abundance variations include (1) inhomogeneous chemical evolution in the proto-cluster environment, (2) supernova ejection in the proto-cluster cloud and (3) pollution of metal-poor gas before complete mixing of the proto-cluster cloud.

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made by both space- and ground-based observatories to measure the likelihood of small planets to orbit in the habitable zones of M-dwarf stars. We now know that most M dwarfs are hosts to closely-packed planetary systems characterized by a paucity of Jupiter-mass planets and the presence of multiple rocky planets, with roughly a third of these rocky M-dwarf planets orbiting within the habitable zone, where they have the potential to support liquid water on their surfaces. Theoretical studies have also quantified the effect on climate and habitability of the interaction between the spectral energy distribution of M-dwarf stars and the atmospheres and surfaces of their planets. These and other recent results fill in knowledge gaps that existed at the time of the previous overview papers published nearly a decade ago by Tarter et al. (2007) and Scalo et al. (2007). In this review we provide a comprehensive picture of the current knowledge of M-dwarf planet occurrence and habitability based on work done in this area over the past decade, and summarize future directions planned in this quickly evolving field.},

	abstract = {We have Fourier-analyzed 941 K2 light curves (LCs) of likely members of Praesepe, measuring periods for 86\% and increasing the number of rotation periods (P) by nearly a factor of four. The distribution of P versus (V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}), a mass proxy, has three different regimes: (V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}) {\textless} 1.3, where the rotation rate rapidly slows as mass decreases; 1.3 {\textless} (V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}) {\textless} 4.5, where the rotation rate slows more gradually as mass decreases; and (V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}) {\textgreater} 4.5, where the rotation rate rapidly increases as mass decreases. In this last regime, there is a bimodal distribution of periods, with few between ∼2 and ∼10 days. We interpret this to mean that once M stars start to slow down, they do so rapidly. The K2 period-color distribution in Praesepe (∼790 Myr) is much different than that in the Pleiades (∼125 Myr) for late F, G, K, and early-M stars; the overall distribution moves to longer periods and is better described by two line segments. For mid-M stars, the relationship has a similarly broad scatter and is steeper in Praesepe. The diversity of LCs and of periodogram types is similar in the two clusters; about a quarter of the periodic stars in both clusters have multiple significant periods. Multi-periodic stars dominate among the higher masses, starting at a bluer color in Praesepe ((V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}) ∼ 1.5) than in the Pleiades ((V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\}) ∼ 2.6). In Praesepe, there are relatively more LCs that have two widely separated periods, \{\{Δ \}\}P{\textgreater} 6 \{days\}. Some of these could be examples of M star binaries where one star has spun down but the other has not.},

	abstract = {Solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), especially the larger ones, emanate from active regions (ARs). With the aim of understanding the magnetic properties that govern such flares and eruptions, we systematically survey all flare events with Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellite levels of ≥M5.0 within 45° from disk center between 2010 May and 2016 April. These criteria lead to a total of 51 flares from 29 ARs, for which we analyze the observational data obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory. More than 80\% of the 29 ARs are found to exhibit δ-sunspots, and at least three ARs violate Hale’s polarity rule. The flare durations are approximately proportional to the distance between the two flare ribbons, to the total magnetic flux inside the ribbons, and to the ribbon area. From our study, one of the parameters that clearly determine whether a given flare event is CME-eruptive or not is the ribbon area normalized by the sunspot area, which may indicate that the structural relationship between the flaring region and the entire AR controls CME productivity. AR characterization shows that even X-class events do not require δ-sunspots or strong-field, high-gradient polarity inversion lines. An investigation of historical observational data suggests the possibility that the largest solar ARs, with magnetic flux of 2 × 1023 Mx, might be able to produce “superflares” with energies of the order of 1034 erg. The proportionality between the flare durations and magnetic energies is consistent with stellar flare observations, suggesting a common physical background for solar and stellar flares.},

We use Gaia DR1 Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) data complemented by Hipparcos-2 data for bright stars not contained in TGAS. We supplement the astrometric data with radial velocities collected from a dozen literature sources. By assuming that all cluster members move with the mean cluster velocity to within the velocity dispersion, we use the observed and the expected motions of the stars to determine individual cluster membership probabilities. We subsequently derive improved parallaxes through maximum-likelihood kinematic modelling of the cluster. This method has an iterative component to deal with `outliers', caused for instance by double stars or escaping members. Our method extends an existing method and supports the mixed presence of stars with and without radial velocities. We find 251 candidate members, 200 of which have a literature radial velocity, and 70 of which are new candidate members with TGAS astrometry. The cluster is roughly spherical in its centre but significantly flattened at larger radii. The observed colour-absolute magnitude diagram shows a clear binary sequence. The kinematically modelled parallaxes that we derive are a factor ∼1.7 / 2.9 more precise than the TGAS / Hipparcos-2 values and allow us to derive an extremely sharp main sequence. This sequence shows evidence for fine-detailed structure that is elegantly explained by the full spectrum turbulence model of convection.},

	abstract = {Understanding the formation and evolution of our Galaxy requires accurate distances, ages, and chemistry for large populations of field stars. Here, we present several updates to our spectrophotometric distance code, which can now also be used to estimate ages, masses, and extinctions for individual stars. Given a set of measured spectrophotometric parameters, we calculate the posterior probability distribution over a given grid of stellar evolutionary models, using flexible Galactic stellar-population priors. The code (called StarHorse) can accommodate different observational data sets, prior options, partially missing data, and the inclusion of parallax information into the estimated probabilities. We validate the code using a variety of simulated stars as well as real stars with parameters determined from asteroseismology, eclipsing binaries, and isochrone fits to star clusters. Our main goal in this validation process is to test the applicability of the code to field stars with known Gaia-like parallaxes. The typical internal precisions (obtained from realistic simulations of an APOGEE+Gaia-like sample) are \{∼eq \} 8 \{per cent\} in distance, \{∼eq \} 20 \{per cent\} in age, \{∼eq \} 6 \{per cent\} in mass, and ≃ 0.04 mag in AV. The median external precision (derived from comparisons with earlier work for real stars) varies with the sample used, but lies in the range of \{∼eq \} [0,2] \{per cent\} for distances, \{∼eq \} [12,31] \{per cent\} for ages, \{∼eq \} [4,12] \{per cent\} for masses, and ≃ 0.07 mag for AV.

	abstract = {Stellar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) may play an important role in mass- and angular momentum loss of young Sun-like stars. If occurring frequently, they may also have a strong effect on planetary evolution by increasing atmospheric erosion. So far it has not been possible to infer the occurrence frequency of stellar CMEs from observations. Based on their close relation with flares on the Sun, we develop an empirical model combining solar flare-CME relationships with stellar flare rates to estimate the CME activity of young Sun-like and late-type main-sequence stars. By comparison of the obtained CME mass-loss rates with observations of total mass-loss rates, we find that our modelled rates may exceed those from observations by orders of magnitude for the most active stars. This reveals a possible limit to the extrapolation of such models to the youngest stars. We find that the most uncertain component in the model is the flare-CME association rate adopted from the Sun, which does not properly account for the likely stronger coronal confinement in active stars. Simple estimates of this effect reveal a possible suppression of CME rates by several orders of magnitude for young stars, indicating that this issue should be addressed in more detail in the future.},

	abstract = {Recently, many superflares on solar-type stars have been discovered as white-light flares (WLFs). The statistical study found a correlation between their energies (E) and durations (τ): τ {\textbackslash}propto \{E\}0.39, similar to those of solar hard/soft X-ray flares, τ {\textbackslash}propto \{E\}0.2\{--0.33\}. This indicates a universal mechanism of energy release on solar and stellar flares, i.e., magnetic reconnection. We here carried out statistical research on 50 solar WLFs observed with Solar Dynamics Observatory/HMI and examined the correlation between the energies and durations. As a result, the E-τ relation on solar WLFs (τ {\textbackslash}propto \{E\}0.38) is quite similar to that on stellar superflares (τ {\textbackslash}propto \{E\}0.39). However, the durations of stellar superflares are one order of magnitude shorter than those expected from solar WLFs. We present the following two interpretations for the discrepancy: (1) in solar flares, the cooling timescale of WLFs may be longer than the reconnection one, and the decay time of solar WLFs can be elongated by the cooling effect; (2) the distribution can be understood by applying a scaling law (τ {\textbackslash}propto \{E\}1/3\{B\}-5/3) derived from the magnetic reconnection theory. In the latter case, the observed superflares are expected to have 2-4 times stronger magnetic field strength than solar flares.},

	abstract = {Stars with convective envelopes display magnetic activity, which decreases over time due to the magnetic braking of the star. This age dependence of magnetic activity is well studied for younger stars, but the nature of this dependence for older stars is not well understood. This is mainly because absolute stellar ages for older stars are hard to measure. However, relatively accurate stellar ages have recently come into reach through asteroseismology. In this work, we present X-ray luminosities, which are a measure for magnetic activity displayed by the stellar coronae, for 24 stars with well-determined ages older than a gigayear. We find 14 stars with detectable X-ray luminosities and use these to calibrate the age-activity relationship. We find a relationship between stellar X-ray luminosity, normalized by the stellar surface area, and age that is steeper than the relationships found for younger stars, with an exponent of -2.80 ± 0.72. Previous studies have found values for the exponent of the age-activity relationship ranging between -1.09 and -1.40, dependent on spectral type, for younger stars. Given that there are recent reports of a flattening relationship between age and rotational period for old cool stars, one possible explanation is that we witness a strong steepening of the relationship between activity and rotation.},

A joint analysis of our radial-velocity measurements and the K2 light curve shows the 6.5 day orbit to be nearly circular.

The distance we infer, \{283\}-16+18 pc, corresponds to a parallax in good agreement with the Gaia/DR2 value for the star.

Isochrones for these same ages and the measured composition, along with our reddening estimate for EPIC 219394517, also show generally good agreement with the optical and near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams of the cluster, which can be constructed with no free parameters as the distances of all member stars are known from Gaia.},

We develop a fast regularization scheme for pixel-level decorrelation (PLD) and adapt the algorithm to include the PLD vectors of other stars to enhance the predictive power of the model and minimize overfitting, particularly for faint stars. We also modify PLD to work for saturated stars and improve its performance on variable stars, although some high-frequency variables may still suffer from overfitting. On average, EVEREST 2.0 light curves have 10-20\% higher photometric precision than those in version 1, yielding the highest-precision light curves at all \{Kp\} magnitudes of any publicly available K2 catalog. For most K2 campaigns, we recover the original Kepler precision to at least \{Kp\} = 14, and to at least \{Kp\} = 15 for campaigns 1, 5, 6, and 13. We also detrend most short-cadence targets observed by K2, obtaining even higher photometric precision for these stars. Like all aggressive, flexible models, EVEREST is prone to overfitting, and may cause a decrease in transit depths by ∼10\% we urge users to mask signals of interest using our open-source software, which we show removes this bias. Light curves for campaigns 0-8 and 10-13 are available online in the EVEREST catalog, which will be updated with future campaigns.

	abstract = {M dwarf stars are known for their vigorous flaring. This flaring could impact the climate of orbiting planets, making it important to characterize M dwarf flares at the short wavelengths that drive atmospheric chemistry and escape. We conducted a far-ultraviolet flare survey of six M dwarfs from the recent MUSCLES (Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems) observations, as well as four highly active M dwarfs with archival data. When comparing absolute flare energies, we found the active-M-star flares to be about 10× more energetic than inactive-M-star flares. However, when flare energies were normalized by the star’s quiescent flux, the active and inactive samples exhibited identical flare distributions, with a power-law index of -\{0.76\}-0.1+0.09 (cumulative distribution). The rate and distribution of flares are such that they could dominate the FUV energy budget of M dwarfs, assuming the same distribution holds to flares as energetic as those cataloged by Kepler and ground-based surveys. We used the observed events to create an idealized model flare with realistic spectral and temporal energy budgets to be used in photochemical simulations of exoplanet atmospheres. Applied to our own simulation of direct photolysis by photons alone (no particles), we find that the most energetic observed flares have little effect on an Earth-like atmosphere, photolyzing ∼0.01\% of the total O3 column. The observations were too limited temporally (73 hr cumulative exposure) to catch rare, highly energetic flares. Those that the power-law fit predicts occur monthly would photolyze ∼1\% of the O3 column and those it predicts occur yearly would photolyze the full O3 column. Whether such energetic flares occur at the rate predicted is an open question.},

	abstract = {M stars are powerful emitters of far-ultraviolet light. Over long timescales, a significant, possibly dominant, fraction of this emission is produced by stellar flares. Characterizing this emission is critical to understanding the atmospheres of the stars producing it and the atmospheric evolution of the orbiting planets subjected to it. Ultraviolet emission is known to be elevated for several hundred million years after M stars form. Whether or not the same is true of ultraviolet flare activity is a key concern for the evolution of exoplanet atmospheres. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations by the HAZMAT program (HAbitable Zones and M dwarf Activity across Time) detected 18 flares on young (40 Myr) early M stars in the Tucana-Horologium association over 10 hr of observations, 10 having energy {\textgreater}1030 erg. These imply that flares on young M stars are 100-1000× more energetic than those occurring at the same rate on “inactive,” field age M dwarfs. However, when energies are normalized by quiescent emission, there is no statistical difference between the young and field age samples. The most energetic flare observed, dubbed the “Hazflare,” emitted an energy of 1032.1 erg in the FUV, 30× more energetic than any stellar flare previously observed in the FUV with HST’s COS or STIS spectrographs. It was accompanied by 15,500 ± 400 K blackbody emission bright enough to designate it as a superflare (E {\textgreater} 1033 erg), with an estimated bolometric energy of \{10\}\{33.6-0.2+0.1\} erg. This blackbody emitted \{18\}-1+2\% of its flux in the FUV (912-1700 Å), where molecules are generally most sensitive to photolysis. Such hot superflares in young, early M stars could play an important role in the evolution of nascent planetary atmospheres.

	abstract = {The Hyades, Praesepe, and Pleiades are well-studied stellar clusters that anchor important secondary stellar age indicators. Recent studies have shown that main sequence turn off based ages for these clusters may depend on the degree of rotation in the underlying stellar models. Rotation induces structural instabilities that can enhance the chemical mixing of a star, extending its fuel supply. In addition, rotation introduces a modulation of the star’s observed magnitude and color due to the effects of gravity darkening. We aim to investigate the extent to which stellar rotation affects the age determination of star clusters. We utilize the MESA stellar evolution code to create models that cover a range of rotation rates corresponding to Ω/Ωc = 0.0-0.6 in 0.1 dex steps, allowing the assessment of variations in this dimension. The statistical analysis package, MATCH, is employed to derive ages and metallicities by fitting our MESA models to Tycho B T , V T , and 2MASS J, K s color-magnitude diagrams. We find that the derived ages are relatively insensitive to the effects of rotation. For the Hyades, Praesepe, and Pleiades clusters, we derive ages based on synthetic populations that model a distribution of rotation rates or a fixed rate. Across each case, the derived ages tend to agree roughly within errors, near 680, 590, and 110-160 Myr for the Hyades, Praesepe, and Pleiades clusters, respectively. These ages are in agreement with Li depletion boundary-based ages and previous analyses that used nonrotating isochrones. Our methods do not provide a strong constraint on the metallicities of these clusters.},

The RF method is used to calculate membership probabilities of 71,117 stars within 2.°5 of the cluster center in an 11-dimensional parameter space, the photometric data are also taken into account. Based on the RF membership probabilities, we obtain 1502 likely cluster members (≥0.6), 1361 of which are high-probability cluster members (≥0.8). Based on high-probability memberships with high-precision astrometric data, the mean parallax (distance) and proper-motion of the cluster are determined to be 1.1327 ± 0.0018 mas (883 ± 1 pc) and ({\textless} \{μ \}α {\textbackslash}cos δ {\textgreater} , {\textless} \{μ \}δ {\textgreater} ) = (-10.9378 ±0.0078, -2.9465 ± 0.0074) mas yr-1, respectively.

We investigate the spatial structure of the cluster, the core and limiting radius are determined to be 4.‧80 ± 0.‧11 (∼1.23 ± 0.03 pc) and 61.‧98 ± 1.‧50 (∼15.92 ± 0.39 pc), respectively. Our results reveal that an escaped member with high membership probability (∼0.91) is located at a distance of 77‧ (∼20 pc) from the cluster center. Furthermore, our results reveal that at least 26.4\% of the main-sequence stars in M67 are binary stars. We confirm that significant mass segregation has taken place within M67.},

The MLR function is found better if expressed by a six-piece classical MLR (L ∝ Mα) rather than a fifth or a sixth degree polynomial within the mass range of 0.179 ≤ M/M⊙ ≤ 31. The break points separating the mass ranges with classical MLR do not appear to us to be arbitrary. Instead, the data indicate abrupt changes along the mass axis in the mean energy generation per unit of stellar mass. Unlike the MLR function, the MRR and MTR functions cannot be determined over the full range of masses. A single-piece MRR function is calibrated from the radii of stars with M≤1.5 M\_\{⊙\}, while a second single-piece MTR function is found for stars with M{\textgreater} 1.5 M\_\{⊙\}. The missing part of the MRR is computed from the MLR and MTR, while the missing part of the MTR is computed from the MLR and MRR. As a result, we have interrelated the MLR, MRR, and MTR, which are useful in determining the typical absolute physical parameters of main-sequence stars of given masses. These functions are also useful to estimate typical absolute physical parameters from typical Teff values. Thus, we were able to estimate the typical absolute physical parameters of main-sequence stars observed in the Sejong Open cluster Survey, based on that survey's published values for Teff. Since typical absolute physical parameters of main-sequence stars cannot normally be determined in such photometric surveys, the interrelated functions are shown to be useful to compute such missing parameters from similar surveys.},

	abstract = {From an analysis of the long cadence light curves of M and K dwarfs obtained by the K2 observations, 3589 flares on 548 M dwarfs and 1647 flares on 343 K dwarfs have been identified. We compared the M and K dwarfs’ flares with the G dwarfs’ flares reported by Shibayama et al. The later type stars’ flare occurrence frequencies are higher than those of the earlier type stars, but the earlier type stars produce more powerful flares than those of the later type stars. For the stars of all spectral types, the flare activities, including the flare energy, peak amplitude, and percentage of magnetic activity, increase with faster rotation of stars. The longer the flare duration is, the more energy the flare releases, but an upper limit exists. The saturation energy of M, K, and G dwarfs are derived to be about 1 × 1035 erg, 4 × 1035 erg and 1 × 1036 erg, respectively, in the present study. We estimated the power-law indices of the flare frequency distributions of three spectral type stars. They are 1.82 ± 0.02 (M dwarfs) and 1.86 ± 0.02 (K dwarfs) in comparison to the 2.01 ± 0.03 for the G dwarfs found by Shibayama et al. For stars with P rot ≤ 10 days, they are 1.78 ± 0.02 (M dwarfs), 1.82 ± 0.03 (K dwarfs), and 2.09 ± 0.04 (G dwarfs). The power-law indices of flare frequency distributions of the fast-rotating M- and K-type stars are nearly the same. This indicates that the flare or magnetic mechanisms of different types of low-mass stars may be similar in some sense.},

	abstract = {We present a flare catalog of the Kepler mission using the long-cadence data of Data Release 25. This catalog comprises 3420 flare stars and 162,262 flare events. A comparison shows that the flare catalogs of previous studies are seriously polluted by various false-positive signals and artifacts. The incidence of flare stars rises with decreasing temperature, which accords with the theoretical analysis. The flare frequency distributions (FFDs) from F-type stars to M-type stars obey a power-law relation with α ∼ 2, indicating that they have the same mechanism on generating flares. The remarkable incidence and the deviation of FFDs on A-type flare stars imply that they generate flares in a different way. The activity-rotation relation is consistent with previous studies at low temperature bands, whereas it becomes dispersive with increasing temperature. Combined with the Gyrochronology, we find that the mixing of stars of two different dynamos gives rise to the dispersion. We thereby propose a scenario on understanding the activity-rotation relation across the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Based on the scenario and the correspondence of dynamo with regard to activity and rotation, we suggest a new expression on the activity-rotation relation, in which the segmentation is on the basis of the dynamo rather than the rotation period. The rotation distribution of flare stars shows that about 70\% of flare stars rotate faster than 10 days and the rate approaches 95\% at 30 days. Based on the incidence and the rotation distribution of flare stars, we estimate that a superflare with energy ∼1034 erg occurs on the Sun at least once in 5500 yr.},

We have conducted an all-sky volume-limited survey for stellar companions to 1120 M dwarf primaries known to lie within 25 pc of the Sun via trigonometric parallaxes. In addition to a comprehensive literature search, stars were explored in new surveys for companions at separations of 2″-300″. A reconnaissance of wide companions to separations of 300″ was done via blinking archival images. I-band images were used to search our sample for companions at separations of 2″-180″. Various astrometric and photometric methods were used to probe the inner 2″ to reveal close companions. We report the discovery of 20 new companions and identify 56 candidate multiple systems. We find a stellar multiplicity rate of 26.8 ± 1.4\% and a stellar companion rate of 32.4 ± 1.4\% for M dwarfs. There is a broad peak in the separation distribution of the companions at 4-20 au, with a weak trend of smaller projected linear separations for lower mass primaries. A hint that M-dwarf multiplicity may be a function of tangential velocity is found, with faster moving, presumably older, stars found to be multiple somewhat less often. We calculate that stellar companions make up at least 17\% of mass attributed to M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood, with roughly 11\% of M-dwarf mass hidden as unresolved companions. Finally, when considering all M-dwarf primaries and companions, we find that the mass distribution for M dwarfs increases to the end of the stellar main sequence.},

	abstract = {Understanding the impact of active M dwarf stars on the atmospheric equilibrium and surface conditions of a habitable zone Earth-like planet is key to assessing M dwarf planet habitability. Previous modeling of the impact of electromagnetic (EM) radiation and protons from a single large flare on an Earth-like atmosphere indicated that significant and long-term reductions in ozone were possible, but the atmosphere recovered. However, these stars more realistically exhibit frequent flaring with a distribution of different total energies and cadences. Here, we use a coupled 1D photochemical and radiative-convective model to investigate the effects of repeated flaring on the photochemistry and surface UV of an Earth-like planet unprotected by an intrinsic magnetic field. As input, we use time-resolved flare spectra obtained for the dM3 star AD Leonis, combined with flare occurrence frequencies and total energies (typically 1030.5 to 1034 erg) from the 4-year Kepler light curve for the dM4 flare star GJ1243, with varied proton event impact frequency. Our model results show that repeated EM-only flares have little effect on the ozone column depth but that multiple proton events can rapidly destroy the ozone column. Combining the realistic flare and proton event frequencies with nominal CME/SEP geometries, we find the ozone column for an Earth-like planet can be depleted by 94\% in 10 years, with a downward trend that makes recovery unlikely and suggests further destruction. For more extreme stellar inputs, O3 depletion allows a constant ∼0.1-1 W m-2 of UVC at the planet's surface, which is likely detrimental to organic complexity. Our results suggest that active M dwarf hosts may comprehensively destroy ozone shields and subject the surface of magnetically unprotected Earth-like planets to long-term radiation that can damage complex organic structures. However, this does not preclude habitability, as a safe haven for life could still exist below an ocean surface.},

We present follow-up photometry and spectroscopy of all 53 candidates, confirming flare events on 47 M dwarfs, one K dwarf, and one L dwarf. The remaining four objects include a previously identified T Tauri star, a young star with outbursts, and two objects too faint to confirm. A detailed examination of the 49 flare star light curves revealed an additional six flares on five stars, resulting in a total of 55 flares on 49 objects ranging in V-band contrast from ΔV = -1 to -10.2 mag. Using an empirical flare model to estimate the unobserved portions of the flare light curve, we obtain lower limits on the V-band energy emitted during each flare, spanning \{log\}(\{E\}V/\{erg\})=32-35, which are among the most energetic flares detected on M dwarfs. The ASAS-SN M dwarf flare stars show a higher fraction of Hα emission, as well as stronger Hα emission, compared to M dwarfs selected without reference to activity, consistent with belonging to a population of more magnetically active stars. We also examined the distribution of tangential velocities, finding that the ASAS-SN flaring M dwarfs are likely to be members of the thin disk and are neither particularly young nor old.},

	abstract = {We report the latest view of Kepler solar-type (G-type main-sequence) superflare stars, including recent updates with Apache Point Observatory (APO) 3.5 m telescope spectroscopic observations and Gaia-DR2 data. First, we newly conducted APO 3.5 m spectroscopic observations of 18 superflare stars found from Kepler 1-minute time-cadence data. More than half (43 stars) are confirmed to be “single” stars, among 64 superflare stars in total that have been spectroscopically investigated so far in this APO 3.5 m and our previous Subaru/HDS observations. The measurements of v sin i (projected rotational velocity) and chromospheric lines (Ca II H and K and Ca II λ8542) support that the brightness variation of superflare stars is caused by the rotation of a star with large starspots. We then investigated the statistical properties of Kepler solar-type superflare stars by incorporating Gaia-DR2 stellar radius estimates. As a result, the maximum superflare energy continuously decreases as the rotation period P rot increases. Superflares with energies ≲5 × 1034 erg occur on old, slowly rotating Sun-like stars (P rot ∼ 25 days) approximately once every 2000-3000 yr, while young, rapidly rotating stars with P rot ∼ a few days have superflares up to 1036 erg. The maximum starspot area does not depend on the rotation period when the star is young, but as the rotation slows down, it starts to steeply decrease at P rot ≳ 12 days for Sun-like stars. These two decreasing trends are consistent since the magnetic energy stored around starspots explains the flare energy, but other factors like spot magnetic structure should also be considered.},

We compile a sample of 88 stars that span spectral classes K7 to M6 and include stars with metallicity classes from solar-metallicity dwarf stars to the lowest metallicity ultra subdwarfs to test how metallicity changes the stellar radius. We fit models to Palomar Double Spectrograph (DBSP) optical spectra to derive effective temperatures (T eff) and we measure bolometric luminosities (L bol) by combining broad wavelength-coverage photometry with Gaia parallaxes. Radii are then computed by combining the T eff and L bol using the Stefan-Boltzman law. We find that for a given temperature, ultra subdwarfs can be as much as five times smaller than their solar-metallicity counterparts. We present color-radius and color-surface brightness relations that extend down to [Fe/H] of -2.0 dex, in order to aid the radius determination of M subdwarfs, which will be especially important for the WFIRST exoplanetary microlensing survey.},

During the far-ultraviolet (FUV) monitoring observations, the target exhibited several small flares and one large flare (E FUV = 1030.75 erg) that persisted over the entirety of an HST orbit and had an equivalent duration {\textgreater}30,000 s, comparable to the highest relative amplitude event previously recorded in the FUV. The flare spectrum exhibited enhanced line emission from chromospheric, transition region, and coronal transitions and a blue FUV continuum with an unprecedented color temperature of TC ≃ 40,000 ± 10,000 K. In this Letter, we compare the flare FUV continuum emission with parameterizations of radiative hydrodynamic model atmospheres of M star flares. We find that the observed flare continuum can be reproduced using flare models but only with the ad hoc addition of a hot, dense emitting component. This observation demonstrates that flares with hot FUV continuum temperatures and significant extreme-ultraviolet/FUV energy deposition will continue to be of importance to exoplanet atmospheric chemistry and heating, even as the host M dwarfs age beyond their most active evolutionary phases.},

These include 93 stars with no prior \{P\vphantom{\{}\}rot\} measurements; the total number of Hyads with a known \{P\vphantom{\{}\}rot\} is now 232. We then combine literature binary data with Gaia DR2 photometry and astrometry to select single-star sequences in the Hyades and its roughly coeval Praesepe open cluster and derive a new reddening value of A V = 0.035 ± 0.011 for Praesepe. Comparing the effective temperature-\{P\vphantom{\{}\}rot\} distributions for the Hyades and Praesepe, we find that solar-type Hyads rotate, on average, 0.4 day slower than their Praesepe counterparts. This \{P\vphantom{\{}\}rot\} difference indicates that the Hyades is slightly older than Praesepe: we apply a new gyrochronology model tuned with Praesepe and the Sun and find an age difference between the two clusters of 57 Myr. However, this \{P\vphantom{\{}\}rot\} difference decreases and eventually disappears for lower-mass stars. This provides further evidence for stalling in the rotational evolution of these stars and highlights the need for more detailed analysis of angular momentum evolution for stars of different masses and ages.},

Since 2016, Evryscope has enabled the detection of rare events from all stars observed by TESS through multi-year, high-cadence continuous observing. We report around twice the previous largest number of 1034 erg high-cadence flares from nearby cool stars. We find eight flares with amplitudes of 3+ g‧ magnitudes, with the largest reaching 5.6 mag and releasing 1036.2 erg. We observe a 1034 erg superflare from TOI-455 (LTT 1445), a mid-M with a rocky planet candidate. We measure the superflare rate per flare-star and quantify the average flaring of active stars as a function of spectral type, including superflare rates, flare frequency distributions, and typical flare amplitudes in g‧. We confirm superflare morphology is broadly consistent with magnetic reconnection. We estimate starspot coverage necessary to produce superflares, and hypothesize maximum allowed superflare energies and waiting times between flares corresponding to 100\% coverage of the stellar hemisphere. We observe decreased flaring at high Galactic latitudes. We explore the effects of superflares on ozone loss to planetary atmospheres: we observe one superflare with sufficient energy to photodissociate all ozone in an Earth-like atmosphere in one event. We find 17 stars that may deplete an Earth-like atmosphere via repeated flaring. Of the 1822 stars around which TESS may discover temperate rocky planets, we observe 14.6\% ± 2\% emit large flares.},

	abstract = {Superflares, which are strong explosions on stars, have been well studied with the progress of spacetime-domain astronomy. In this work, we present the study of superflares on solar-type stars using Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. Thirteen sectors of observations during the first year of the TESS mission covered the southern hemisphere of the sky, containing 25,734 solar-type stars. We verified 1216 superflares on 400 solar-type stars through automatic search and visual inspection with 2 minute cadence data. Our result suggests a higher superflare frequency distribution than the result from Kepler. This may be because the majority of TESS solar-type stars in our data set are rapidly rotating stars. The power-law index γ of the superflare frequency distribution ( \$\{dN\}/\{dE\}{\textbackslash}propto \{E\}{\textasciicircum}\{-{\textbackslash}gamma \}\$ ) is constrained to be γ = 2.16 ± 0.10, which is a little larger than that of solar flares but consistent with the results from Kepler. Because only seven superflares of Sun-like stars are detected, we cannot give a robust superflare occurrence frequency. Four stars were accompanied by unconfirmed hot planet candidates. Therefore, superflares may possibly be caused by stellar magnetic activities instead of planet-star interactions. We also find an extraordinary star, TIC43472154, which exhibits about 200 superflares per year. In addition, the correlation between the energy and duration of superflares ( \$\{T\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{duration\}\}{\textbackslash}propto \{E\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}beta \}\$ ) is analyzed. We derive the power-law index to be β = 0.42 ± 0.01, which is a little larger than β = 1/3 from the prediction according to magnetic reconnection theory.},

We mainly want to study the relationship between chromospheric activity and flares, and their relations of magnetic activity and rotation period. We have obtained the maximum catalog of 516,688 M-type stellar spectra of 480,912 M stars from LAMOST DR5 and calculated their equivalent widths of chromospheric activity indicators (Hα, Hβ, Hγ, Hδ, Ca II H\&K, and He I D3). Using the Hα indicator, 40,464 spectra of 38,417 M stars show chromospheric activity, and 1791 of these 5499 M-type stars with repeated observations have Hα variability. We used an automatic detection plus visual inspection method to detect 17,432 flares on 8964 M-type stars from the catalog by cross-matching LAMOST DR5 and the Kepler and K2 databases. We used the Lomb-Scargle method to calculate their rotation periods. We find that the flare frequency is consistent with the ratio of activities of these chromospheric activity indicators as a function of spectral type in M0-M3. We find the equivalent widths of Hα and Ca II H have a significant statistical correlation with the flare amplitude in M-type stars. We confirm that the stellar flare is affected by both the stellar magnetic activity and the rotation period. Finally, using the Hα equivalent width equal to 0.75 Å and using the rotation period equal to 10 days as the threshold for the M-type stellar flare time frequency are almost equivalent.},

This map covers the sky north of a decl. of -30°, out to a distance of a few kiloparsecs. This new map contains three major improvements over our previous work. First, the inclusion of Gaia parallaxes dramatically improves distance estimates to nearby stars. Second, we incorporate a spatial prior that correlates the dust density across nearby sightlines. This produces a smoother map, with more isotropic clouds and smaller distance uncertainties, particularly to clouds within the nearest kiloparsec. Third, we infer the dust density with a distance resolution that is four times finer than in our previous work, to accommodate the improvements in signal-to-noise enabled by the other improvements. As part of this work, we infer the distances, reddenings, and types of 799 million stars.

More information about the map, as well as an interactive viewer, can be found at argonaut.skymaps.info.)

This allows us to identify bona fide flares in single-epoch observations on time-scales of less than four minutes. Using a correlation-based outlier search algorithm we find 254 flare events in the amplitude range of Δu ∼ 0.1 to 5 mag. In agreement with previous work, we observe the flaring fraction of M dwarfs to increase from ∼30 to ∼1000 per million stars for spectral types M0 to M5. We also confirm the decrease in flare fraction with larger vertical distance from the Galactic plane which is expected from declining stellar activity with age. Based on precise distances from Gaia DR2, we find a steep decline in the flare fraction from the plane to 150 pc vertical distance and a significant flattening towards larger distances. We then reassess the strong type dependence in the flaring fraction with a volume-limited sample within a distance of 50 pc from the Sun: in this sample the trend disappears and we find instead a constant fraction of ∼1 650 per million stars for spectral types M1 to M5. Finally, large-amplitude flares with ΔI {\textgreater} 1 mag are very rare with a fraction of ∼0.5 per million M dwarfs. Hence, we expect that M-dwarf flares will not confuse SkyMapper's search for kilonovae from gravitational-wave events. proper references for those databases (or follow their guideline on citation).},

Here, we report on chromospheric Ca II H and K line measurements for 26 main-sequence cool stars with asteroseismic ages older than a gigayear and spectral types F and G. We find that for the G stars and the cooler F-type stars that still have convective envelopes the magnetic activity continues to decrease at stellar ages above 1 Gyr. Our magnetic activity measurements do not show evidence for a stalling of the magnetic braking mechanism, which has been reported for stellar rotation versus age for G- and F-type stars.

To specify the conditions favorable for the origin, development and sustainment of life as we know it in other worlds, we need to understand the nature of astrospheric, atmospheric and surface environments of exoplanets in habitable zones around G-K-M dwarfs including our young Sun. Global environment is formed by propagated disturbances from the planet-hosting stars in the form of stellar flares, coronal mass ejections, energetic particles, and winds collectively known as astrospheric space weather. Its characterization will help in understanding how an exoplanetary ecosystem interacts with its host star, as well as in the specification of the physical, chemical and biochemical conditions that can create favorable and/or detrimental conditions for planetary climate and habitability along with evolution of planetary internal dynamics over geological timescales. A key linkage of (astro) physical, chemical, and geological processes can only be understood in the framework of interdisciplinary studies with the incorporation of progress in heliophysics, astrophysics, planetary and Earth sciences. The assessment of the impacts of host stars on the climate and habitability of terrestrial (exo)planets will significantly expand the current definition of the habitable zone to the biogenic zone and provide new observational strategies for searching for signatures of life. The major goal of this paper is to describe and discuss the current status and recent progress in this interdisciplinary field and to provide a new roadmap for the future development of the emerging field of exoplanetary science and astrobiology.},

We identified 11 flares on 9 L dwarfs with equivalent durations of (1.3-198) h and total (UV/optical/IR) energies of ≥0.9 × 1032 erg. Two superflares with energies of {\textgreater}1033 erg were detected on an L5 dwarf (VVV BD001): this is the coolest object so far on which flares have been identified. The larger superflare on this L5 dwarf has an energy of 4.6 × 1034 erg and an amplitude of {\textgreater}300 times the photospheric level: so far, this is the largest amplitude flare detected by the Kepler/K2 mission. The next coolest star on which we identified a flare was an L2 dwarf: 2MASS J08585891+1804463. Combining the energies of all the flares which we have identified on 9 L dwarfs with the total observation time which was dedicated by Kepler to all 45 L dwarfs, we construct a composite flare frequency distribution (FFD). The FFD slope is quite shallow (-0.51 ± 0.17), consistent with earlier results reported by Paudel et al. for one particular L0 dwarf, for which the FFD slope was found to be -0.34. Using the composite FFD, we predict that, in early- and mid-L dwarfs, a superflare of energy 1033 erg occurs every 2.4 yr and a superflare of energy 1034 erg occurs every 7.9 yr. Analysis of our L dwarf flares suggests that magnetic fields of ≥0.13-1.3 kG are present on the stellar surface: such fields could suppress Type II radio bursts.},

	abstract = {Superflares on solar-type stars have been a rapidly developing field ever since the launch of Kepler. Over the years, there have been several studies investigating the statistics of these explosive events. In this study, we present a statistical analysis of stellar flares on solar-type stars made using photometric data in 2-min cadence from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite of the whole Southern hemisphere (sectors 1-13). We derive rotational periods for all the stars in our sample from rotational modulations present in the light curve as a result of large star-spot(s) on the surface. We identify 1980 stellar flares from 209 solar-type stars with energies in the range of 1031-1036 erg (using the solar flare classification, this corresponds to X1-X100 000) and conduct an analysis into their properties. We investigate the rotational phase of the flares and find no preference for any phase, suggesting the flares are randomly distributed. As a benchmark, we use GOES data of solar flares to detail the close relationship between solar flares and sunspots. In addition, we also calculate approximate spot areas for each of our stars and compare this to flare number, rotational phase, and flare energy. Additionally, two of our stars were observed in the continuous viewing zone with light-curves spanning 1 yr; as a result we examine the stellar variability of these stars in more detail.},

	abstract = {Enhanced continuum brightness is observed in many flares (“white light flares”), yet it is still unclear which processes contribute to the emission. To understand the transport of energy needed to account for this emission, we must first identify both the emission processes and the emission source regions. Possibilities include heating in the chromosphere causing optically thin or thick emission from free-bound transitions of Hydrogen, and heating of the photosphere causing enhanced H- continuum brightness. To investigate these possibilities, we combine observations from Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), SDO/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, and the ground-based Facility Infrared Spectrometer instrument, covering wavelengths in the far-UV, near-UV (NUV), visible, and infrared during the X1 flare SOL20140329T17:48. Fits of blackbody spectra to infrared and visible wavelengths are reasonable, yielding radiation temperatures ∼6000-6300 K. The NUV emission, formed in the upper photosphere under undisturbed conditions, exceeds these simple fits during the flare, requiring extra emission from the Balmer continuum in the chromosphere. Thus, the continuum originates from enhanced radiation from photosphere (visible-IR) and chromosphere (NUV). From the standard thick-target flare model, we calculate the energy of the nonthermal electrons observed by Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscope Imager (RHESSI) and compare it to the energy radiated by the continuum emission. We find that the energy contained in most electrons {\textgreater}40 keV, or alternatively, of ∼10\%-20\% of electrons {\textgreater}20 keV is sufficient to explain the extra continuum emission of ∼(4-8) × 1010 erg s-1 cm-2. Also, from the timing of the RHESSI HXR and the IRIS observations, we conclude that the NUV continuum is emitted nearly instantaneously when HXR emission is observed with a time difference of no more than 15 s.},

We applied the network to 3200 young stars in order to evaluate flare rates as a function of age and spectral type. The CNN takes a few seconds to identify flares on a single light curve. We also measured rotation periods for 1500 of our targets and find that flares of all amplitudes are present across all spot phases, suggesting high spot coverage across the entire surface. Additionally, flare rates and amplitudes decrease for stars tage {\textgreater} 50 Myr across all temperatures Teff ≥ 4000 K, while stars from 2300 ≤ Teff {\textless} 4000 K show no evolution across 800 Myr. Stars of Teff ≤ 4000 K also show higher flare rates and amplitudes across all ages. We investigate the effects of high flare rates on photoevaporative atmospheric mass loss for young planets.

This source was independently identified by Kendall et al. in the SuperCOSMOS Sky Survey. Resolved JHK photometry and low-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy demonstrate that this system is composed of two well-separated (1.174''+/-0.016'') L dwarfs. Component classifications are derived using both spectral ratios and comparison to the near-infrared spectra of previously classified field L dwarfs. Physical association for the pair is deduced from the large common proper motion of the components (μ=0.73''+/-0.03'' yr-1) and their similar spectrophotometric distances (19+/-2 pc). The projected separation of the binary, 22+/-2 AU, is consistent with maximum separation/total system-mass trends for very low mass binaries. The 2MASS J1520-4422 system exhibits both large tangential (66+/-7 km s-1) and radial velocities (-70+/-18 km s-1), and its motion in the local standard of rest suggests that it is an old member of the Galactic disk population. This system joins a growing list of well-separated ({\textgreater}0.5"), very low mass binaries, and is an excellent target for resolved optical spectroscopy to constrain its age, as well as trace activity/rotation trends near the hydrogen-burning limit.},

We find 2778 proper motion candidates, 647 of which are not listed in SIMBAD. After comparison to Digitized Sky Survey images, we find that 107 of our proper motion candidates lack counterparts at B, R, and I bands and are thus 2MASS-only detections. We present results of spectroscopic follow-up of 188 targets that include the infrared-only sources along with selected optical-counterpart sources with faint reduced proper motions or interesting colors. We also establish a set of near-infrared spectroscopic standards with which to anchor near-infrared classifications for our objects. Among the discoveries are six young field brown dwarfs, five "red L" dwarfs, three L-type subdwarfs, twelve M-type subdwarfs, eight "blue L" dwarfs, and several T dwarfs. We further refine the definitions of these exotic classes to aid future identification of similar objects. We examine their kinematics and find that both the "blue L" and "red L" dwarfs appear to be drawn from a relatively old population. This survey provides a glimpse of the kinds of research that will be possible through time-domain infrared projects such as the UKIDSS Large Area Survey, various VISTA surveys, and WISE, and also through z- or y-band enabled, multi-epoch surveys such as Pan-STARRS and LSST.

These sources were culled from a large near-infrared spectral sample of L and T dwarfs observed with the Infrared Telescope Facility SpeX spectrograph. Candidates were selected on the basis of spectral ratios which segregate known (resolved) L dwarf/T dwarf pairs from presumably single sources. Composite templates, constructed by combining 13,581 pairs of absolute flux-calibrated spectra, are shown to provide statistically superior fits to the spectra of our 17 candidates as compared to single templates. Ten of these candidates appear to have secondary components that are significantly brighter than their primaries over the 1.0-1.3 μm band, indicative of rapid condensate depletion at the L dwarf/T dwarf transition. Our results support prior indications of enhanced multiplicity amongst early-type T dwarfs; 53\% ± 7\% of the T0-T4 dwarfs in our spectral sample are found to be either resolved or unresolved (candidate) pairs, although this is consistent with an intrinsic (volume complete) brown dwarf binary fraction of only 15\%. If verified, this sample of spectral binaries more than doubles the number of known L dwarf/T dwarf transition pairs, enabling a broader exploration of this poorly understood phase of brown dwarf atmospheric evolution.},

This conclusion is based on low-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy that reveals a subtle but distinctive absorption feature at 1.6 μ m . The feature, which is also present in the combined light spectrum of the M8.5 + T6 binary SCR 1845-6357, arises from the combination of FeH absorption from an M8.5 primary and pseudocontinuum flux from a T5 ± 1 secondary, as ascertained from binary spectral templates constructed from empirical data. The binary templates provide a far superior match to the overall near-infrared spectral energy distribution of 2MASS J0320-0446 than any single comparison spectra. Laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO) imaging observations, including the first application of LGS AO aperture mask interferometry, fail to resolve a faint companion, restricting the projected separation of the system to less than 8.3 AU at the time of observation. 2MASS J0320-0446 is the second very low mass binary to be identified from unresolved, low-resolution, near-infrared spectroscopy, a technique that complements traditional high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic methods.

	abstract = {Current ideas on the early stages of star formation suggest strongly that proto-stars enter the pre-main sequence phase rotating rapidly. The subsequent rotational evolution of both single and binary stars is largely determined by angular momentum transport by a magnetically-controlled stellar wind. A massive star with a cool corona but with a modest relic magnetic field may be prevented from fragmenting into a binary system through the braking action of a centrifugally-driven wind. A late-type pre-main sequence star will generate by dynamo action a magnetic field of surface strength Bo that depends on the angular velocity Ω. The consequent braking can be powerful enough to cause spin-down in spite of the contraction. The predicted Ω(t) law depends on the Bo (Ω) relation, on whether the wind is thermal, thermo-centrifugal, or magneto-centrifugal, and on the fraction of the magnetosphere with open field-line. Angular momentum loss from a tidally locked binary pair can lead to the formation of late-type contact binaries with rapidly rotating members, and ultimately to their coalescence into one rapid rotator.},

It is found that the mean level of their Ca II H and K emission (averaged over 15 years) is correlated with rotation period, as expected. However, there is a further dependence of the emission on spectral type. When expressed as the ratio of chromospheric flux to total bolometric flux, the emission is well correlated with the parameter P(obs)/tau(c), where P(obs) is the observed rotation period and tau(c)(B - V) is a theoretically-derived convective overturn time, calculated assuming a mixing length to scale height ratio alpha of about 2. This finding is consonant with general predictions of dynamo theory, if the relation between chromospheric emission and dynamo-generated magnetic fields is essentially independent of rotation rate and spectral type for the stars considered. The dependence of mean chromospheric emission on rotation and spectral type is essentially the same for stars above and below the Vaughan-Preston (1980) 'gap', thus casting doubt on explanations of the gap in terms of a discontinuity in dynamo characteristics.},

These models predict ratios of Ca II to hydrogen emission which are much greater than those observed; they also predict Balmer line profiles which are much narrower than those observed. It is inferred that additional heating is taking place in the upper chromosphere beyond that assumed in the models. The observed flare continuum is much bluer than that computed from the models; the observations fit a blackbody spectrum with T approximately equal to 8500-9500 K.

The time integral of the centimetric radio burst corresponds best to the 1.87 A line intensity during the rise to maximum X-ray intensity. The constancy of line emission from Fe ix through Fe xv, coupled with strong enhancements in higher ionization stages, suggests that additional material, not originally at coronal temperature, is rapidly heated and elevated to high stages of ionization during the event. Such heating and ionization may be the result of collisional losses by energetic electrons which are also responsible for the impulsive microwave burst},

Although these magnetic fields are difficult to detect directly, the dramatic stellar flares, believed to be the result of magnetic reconnection, have been observed for many years on dwarf Me (dMe) stars. Here we correlate Einstein observations of the X-ray flux of quiescent dMe stars with the time-averaged energy emitted by flares in the Johnson-U band, showing that the X-ray energy emitted by the coronae of these stars is about an order of magnitude greater than the U-band flare energy. From our estimate of the ratio of the total radiation emitted to the U-band flux, it is possible that, if a similar amount of energy were dissipated in the stellar atmosphere, then the observed flare events could heat the coronae of these stars.},

The number of companions per AU of semimajor axis is computed and found to decline monotonically toward larger semimajor axes. The period distribution exhibits a unimodal broad maximum with a peak in the range 9-220 yr, corresponding to separations of 3-30 AU, similar to that for G dwarf binaries. Fifty-eight percent of nearby M dwarf primaries are found to be single, and 42 +/- 9 percent have companions. The M-dwarf binary frequency is lower than that for G dwarfs (about 57 percent), owing partly to the smaller range of companion masses included, i.e., companions less massive than the M- or G-type primary.},

These parameters include the flare duration, the peak counting rate, the peak hard X-ray flux, the total energy in electrons, and the peak energy flux in electrons (the latter two computed assuming a thick-target flare model). The energies were computed above a threshold energy between 25 and 50 keV. All of the distributions can be represented by power laws above the HXRBS sensitivity threshold. Correlations among these parameters are determined from linear regression fits as well as from the slopes of the frequency distributions. Variations of the frequency distributions were investigated with respect to the solar activity cycle. Theoretical models for the frequency distribution of flare parameters depend on the probability of flaring and the temporal evolution of the flare energy build-up. Our results are consistent with stochastic flaring and exponential energy build-up, with an average build-up time constant that is 0.5 times the mean time between flares. The measured distributions of flares are also consistent with predicted distributions of flares from computer simulations of avalanche models that are governed by the principle of self-organized criticality.},

It was found that all 18 stars of spectral type F8 V or later in this sample were variable, confirming that low-level photometric variability is a ubiquitous and persistent characteristic of Hyades stars later than spectral type F8 V. On the other hand, the six stars earlier than spectral type F7 V were not detectably variable. Contemporaneous Ca II H + K emission flux measurements for five of the 24 stars, spectral types F8 V to G2 V, were obtained at Mount Wilson Observatory and showed that H + K emission flux varies inversely with respect to photometric brightness on both long-term and rotational time scales. Rotation periods were measured for a total of 23 Hyades stars ranging in spectral type from F8 V to K8 V. It was found that Hyades stars conform reasonably well to the 'Rossby relation', which relates chromospheric activity to the ratio of rotation period and convective turnover time scale.},

The sensitivity of the rotation velocity to the various wind model parameters, the initial angular momenta, and the time dependence of the angular velocity for each mass is shown. The theoretical results are compared with observational ones, and it is found that the existence of very rapidly rotating stars in young clusters implies that low-mass stars are formed with a large spread of angular momentum. The high efficiency of angular momentum loss through magnetic stellar winds causes the rotation velocity to become less dependent on initial angular momentum J0 with time; by 300 million yur, the rotation velocity becomes independent of J0. This results in a decrease with time in the spread of rotation velocities as a function of stellar mass in young clusters.},

	abstract = {We have undertaken a program of ground- and space-based observations to measure photometric rotation periods and X-ray luminosities for late-type stars in the young open cluster IC 2391. At an age of ∼30 Myr, IC 2391 is an ideal cluster in which to observe conditions at the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) since the solar-type stars within this cluster have not been on the main sequence long enough to undergo significant magnetic braking. For late-type stars, the ZAMS represents the endpoint of pre-main-sequence evolution, wherein gravitational contraction and interactions with circumstellar accretion disks dominate the angular momentum evolution of the star. The ZAMS also represents the beginning of the main-sequence life of the star, wherein its subsequent evolution is dominated by magnetic braking. Knowledge of ZAMS stellar parameters, such as rotation rates and activity levels, is therefore crucial for accurate theoretical model predictions. Our survey of IC 2391 X-ray sources has revealed a number of new candidates for cluster membership, most of these being late-type stars. Among the solar-type stars in IC 2391, we find a factor of ∼20 spread in the distribution of rotation periods and also in the distribution of X-ray luminosities. We therefore conclude that stars arrive on the ZAMS with a wide range of rotation rates and activity levels. When we compare IC 2391 with older clusters, such as the Pleiades and the Hyades, we find there is an overall decline in the median rotation rate and X-ray luminosity with age, but the dispersion in X-ray luminosity, as a fraction of the median value, actually grows larger. This is because the young, rapidly rotating stars lie along a plateau of magnetic saturation, where LX has a weak dependence on rotation period, while for the older, more slowly rotating stars, the weaker LX has a strong dependence on rotation period. We find an abrupt turnover in the Rossby diagram near NR = 0.3, which suggests there is a fundamental change in the nature of dynamo activity for rapidly rotating stars.},

We examine the possibility that these transient brightenings have much contribution to heating of the active-region corona. Imaging observations provide the following physical conditions: temperature, 4--8 MK; emission measure, 10(44.5) --10(47.5) cm(-3) ; electron density, 2 times 10(9) --2 times 10(10) cm(-3) ; gas pressure, 5--20 dyne cm(-2) ; loop length, 5 times 10(3) --4 times 10(4) km; loop width, 2 times 10(3) --7 times 10(3) km; and duration, 2--7 min. The energy involved in the observed transient brightenings is estimated to range from 10(25) to 10(29) erg. The frequency distribution as a function of the energy can be represented by a single power-law with an index of 1.5--1.6 in the energy range greater than 10(27) erg, although the distribution deviates from a power-law in the energy range less than 10(27) erg due to the instrument dead time and/or obscuration by bright coronal features. The single power-law of the frequency distribution thus appears to extend from the solar flare range down to an energy of 10(27) erg. The total energy supplied by transient brightenings and flares, assuming that the power-law continues to lower energy, is estimated to be at most a factor of 5 smaller than the heating rate required for the active-region corona. We need weaker events with an occurrence rate much higher than the extrapolated power-law to explain the heating of the active-region corona with transient brightenings.},

The new library consists of 131 flux-calibrated spectra, encompassing all normal spectral types and luminosity classes at solar abundance, and metal-weak and metal-rich F-K dwarf and G-K giant components. Each library spectrum was formed by combining data from several sources overlapping in wavelength coverage. The SIMBAD database, measured colors, and line strengths were used to check that each input component has closely similar stellar type. The library has complete spectral coverage from 1150 to 10620 Å for all components and to 25000 Å for about half of them, mainly later types of solar abundance. Missing spectral coverage in the infrared currently consists of a smooth energy distribution formed from standard colors for the relevant types. The library is designed to permit inclusion of additional digital spectra, particularly of non-solar abundance stars in the infrared, as they become available. The library spectra are each given as F\_lambda versus lambda, from 1150 to 25000 Å in steps of 5 Å. A program to combine the library spectra in the ratios appropriate to a selected isochrone is described and an example of a spectral component signature of a composite population of solar age and metallicity is illustrated. The library spectra and associated tables are available as text files by remote electronic access.},

	abstract = {The Kepler Mission, launched on 2009 March 6, was designed with the explicit capability to detect Earth-size planets in the habitable zone of solar-like stars using the transit photometry method. Results from just 43 days of data along with ground-based follow-up observations have identified five new transiting planets with measurements of their masses, radii, and orbital periods. Many aspects of stellar astrophysics also benefit from the unique, precise, extended, and nearly continuous data set for a large number and variety of stars. Early results for classical variables and eclipsing stars show great promise. To fully understand the methodology, processes, and eventually the results from the mission, we present the underlying rationale that ultimately led to the flight and ground system designs used to achieve the exquisite photometric performance. As an example of the initial photometric results, we present variability measurements that can be used to distinguish dwarf stars from red giants.},

	abstract = {We propose a simple interpretation of the rotation period data for solar- and late-type stars. The open cluster and Mount Wilson star observations suggest that rotating stars lie primarily on two sequences, initially called I and C. Some stars lie in the intervening gap. These sequences, and the fractional numbers of stars on each sequence, evolve systematically with cluster age, enabling us to construct crude rotational isochrones allowing ``stellar gyrochronology,'' a procedure, on improvement, likely to yield ages for individual field stars. The age and color dependences of the sequences allow the identification of the underlying mechanism, which appears to be primarily magnetic. The majority of solar- and late-type stars possess a dominant Sun-like, or interface, magnetic field, which connects the convective envelope to both the radiative interior of the star and the exterior, where winds can drain off angular momentum. These stars spin down Skumanich style. An age-decreasing fraction of young G, K, and M stars, which are rapid rotators, possess only a convective field, which is not only inefficient in depleting angular momentum but also incapable of coupling the surface convection zone to the inner radiative zone, so that only the outer zone is spun down, and on an exponential timescale. These stars do not yet possess large-scale dynamos. The large-scale magnetic field associated with the dynamo, apparently created by the shear between the decoupled radiative and convective zones, (re)couples the convective and radiative zones and drives a star from the convective to the interface sequence through the gap on a timescale that increases as stellar mass decreases. Fully convective stars do not possess such an interface, cannot generate an interface dynamo, and hence can never make such a transition. Helioseismic results for the present-day Sun agree with this scheme, which also explains the rotational bimodality observed by Herbst and collaborators among pre-main-sequence stars and the termination of this bimodality when stars become fully convective. This paradigm also provides a new basis for understanding stellar X-ray and chromospheric activity, light-element abundances, and perhaps other stellar phenomena that depend on rotation. This is Paper 13 of the WIYN Open Cluster Study (WOCS).},

	abstract = {Recent observations show that chromospheric Hα activity in late M and L dwarfs is much lower than in the earlier M types. This is particularly surprising given that the late M and L dwarfs are comparatively very rapid rotators: in the early M dwarfs, rapid rotation is associated with high activity levels. One possibility is that the drop-off in activity in the late M and L dwarfs is a result of very high electrical resistivities in their dense, cool, and predominantly neutral atmospheres.We calculate the magnetic field diffusivity in the atmospheres of objects with Teff in the range 3000-1500 K (mid M to late L) using the atmospheric structure models of Allard and Hauschildt. We find that the combination of very low ionization fraction and high density in these atmospheres results in very large resistivities and thus efficient field diffusion. While both ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic decay of currents due to ion-electron collisions occur, the primary diffusion effects are due to current decay through collisions of charged particles with neutrals. Moreover, the latter resistivity is a strong function of both effective temperature and optical depth, increasing rapidly as either Teff or optical depth decreases. This has two implications: (1) Any magnetic field present is increasingly decoupled from atmospheric fluid motions as one moves from mid M to L. In the late M and L dwarfs, atmospheric motions cannot lead to equilibrium field configurations very different from potential ones. That is, the magnitude of magnetic stresses generated by atmospheric motions is very small in these objects. We quantify this effect by a simple Reynolds number calculation. (2) Even if magnetic stresses are easily produced by fluid motions in the hot interior (where the coupling between field and matter is good), their propagation up through the atmosphere will be increasingly hampered by the growing atmospheric resistivity as one moves from mid M to late L. Thus both the generation and propagation of magnetic stresses are increasingly damped with decreasing Teff in these cool dwarfs. As a result, the magnetic free energy available for the support of a chromosphere, and activity becomes smaller and smaller with later type. This can account for the observed drop in Hα activity from mid M to L, assuming that activity in these dwarfs is magnetically driven. To check the latter assumption, we estimate the emergent acoustic fluxes in these objects through a Lighthill-Proudman calculation. While the acoustic fluxes also decrease with decreasing Teff, they appear inadequate to explain the observed Hα fluxes in mid M to L dwarfs. In the absence of acoustic heating, magnetic heating indeed seems the most viable way of generating activity. We emphasize that our calculations are equilibrium ones and do not address time-dependent phenomena. We also do not examine the highest atmospheric layers, where correction is not expected, but which we show are rarefied enough to permit charged particles to remain coupled to the field. Finally, while our calculations do not address flares in late M and L dwarfs, we speculate that the latter could be created by buoyant flux tubes that are generated in the interior and rise rapidly through the atmosphere, dissipating their associated currents in the upper atmospheric layers.},

In the first 371 deg2 of actual 2MASS survey data, we have identified another 20 such objects spectroscopically confirmed using the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) at the W. M. Keck Observatory. Because the TiO and VO bands, which dominate the far-optical portions of late-M spectra, disappear in these cooler dwarfs, we define a new spectral class ``L'' in which metallic oxides are replaced by metallic hydrides and neutral alkali metals as the major spectroscopic signatures. We establish classification indices and type all 25 L dwarfs. The 26th ``post-M9.5'' object--Gl 229B--is the prototype of a methane-dominated spectral class, which we propose as class ``T.'' At least five of the 20 2MASS L dwarfs show the 6708 Å lithium doublet at low resolution, the strongest having an equivalent width of 18.5 Å. For objects this cool, the presence of lithium proves that they are substellar. Two other 2MASS objects appear to have lithium lines at the limit of our detectability, which if verified means that at least one-third of our L dwarfs are bona fide brown dwarfs. All of the 2MASS brown dwarfs discovered so far have J-Ks{\textgreater}1.30. We have not yet, despite deliberately searching for them, found any brown dwarfs with colors resembling Gl 229B (J-Ks{\textasciitilde}-0.1).

	abstract = {Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer Deep Survey observations of cool stars (spectral type F to M) have been used to investigate the distribution of coronal flare rates in energy and its relation to activity indicators and rotation parameters. Cumulative and differential flare rate distributions were constructed and fitted with different methods. Power laws are found to approximately describe the distributions. A trend toward flatter distributions for later type stars is suggested in our sample. Assuming that the power laws continue below the detection limit, we have estimated that the superposition of flares with radiated energies of about 1029-1031 ergs could explain the observed radiative power loss of these coronae, while the detected flares are contributing only {\textasciitilde}10\%. Although the power-law index is not correlated with rotation parameters (rotation period, projected rotational velocity, Rossby number) and only marginally with the X-ray luminosity, the flare occurrence rate is correlated with all of them. The occurrence rate of flares with energies larger than 1032 ergs is found to be proportional to the average total stellar X-ray luminosity. Thus, energetic flares occur more often in X-ray bright stars than in X-ray faint stars. The normalized occurrence rate of flares with energies larger than 1032 ergs increases with increasing LX/Lbol and stays constant for saturated stars. A similar saturation is found below a critical Rossby number. The findings are discussed in terms of simple statistical flare models in an attempt to explain the previously observed trend for higher average coronal temperatures in more active stars. It is concluded that flares can contribute a significant amount of energy to coronal heating in active stars.},

We have combined archival survey data from the SDSS, 2MASS, USNOB1.0, and UCAC-2.0 surveys to compile proper motions and photometry for {\textasciitilde}5 million sources over 300 deg2. Of these sources, 1010 stars in Praesepe and 98 stars in Coma Ber are identified as candidate members with probability {\textgreater}80\% 442 and 61 are identified as high-probability candidates for the first time. We estimate that this survey is {\textgreater}90\% complete across a wide range of spectral types (F0-M5 in Praesepe, F5-M6 in Coma Ber). We have also investigated the stellar mass dependence of each cluster's mass and radius in order to quantify the role of mass segregation and tidal stripping in shaping the present-day mass function and spatial distribution of stars. Praesepe shows clear evidence of mass segregation across the full stellar mass range; Coma Ber does not show any clear trend, but low number statistics would mask a trend of the same magnitude as in Praesepe. The mass function for Praesepe (τ {\textasciitilde} 600 Myr; M {\textasciitilde} 500 Modot) follows a power law consistent with that of the field present-day mass function, suggesting that any mass-dependent tidal stripping could have removed only the lowest mass members ({\textless}0.15 Modot). Coma Ber, which is younger but much less massive (τ {\textasciitilde} 400 Myr; M {\textasciitilde} 100 Modot), follows a significantly shallower power law. This suggests that some tidal stripping has occurred, but the low-mass stellar population has not been strongly depleted down to the survey completeness limit ({\textasciitilde}0.12 Modot).},

	abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) are rich resources for studying stellar astrophysics and the structure and formation history of the Galaxy. As new surveys and instruments adopt similar filter sets, it is increasingly important to understand the properties of the ugrizJHKs stellar locus, both to inform studies of "normal" main-sequence stars and enable robust searches for point sources with unusual colors. Using a sample of {\textasciitilde}600,000 point sources detected by SDSS and 2MASS, we tabulate the position and width of the ugrizJHKs stellar locus as a function of g - i color, and provide accurate polynomial fits. We map the Morgan-Keenan spectral type sequence to the median stellar locus by using synthetic photometry of spectral standards and by analyzing 3000 SDSS stellar spectra with a custom spectral typing pipeline, described in the Appendix to this paper. We develop an algorithm to calculate a point source's minimum separation from the stellar locus in a seven-dimensional color space, and use it to robustly identify objects with unusual colors, as well as spurious SDSS/2MASS matches. Analysis of a final catalog of 2117 color outliers identifies 370 white-dwarf/M dwarf (WDMD) pairs, 93 QSOs, and 90 M giant/carbon star candidates, and demonstrates that WDMD pairs and QSOs can be distinguished on the basis of their J - Ks and r - z colors. We also identify a group of objects with correlated offsets in the u - g versus g - r and g - r versus r - i color-color spaces, but subsequent follow-up is required to reveal the nature of these objects. Future applications of this algorithm to a matched SDSS-UKIDSS catalog may well identify additional classes of objects with unusual colors by probing new areas of color-magnitude space.},

	abstract = {We investigate the EUV and X-ray flare rate distribution in radiated energy of the late-type active star AD Leo. Occurrence rates of solar flares have previously been found to be distributed in energy according to a power law, dN/dE{\textasciitilde}E-α, with a power-law index α in the range 1.5-2.6. If α{\textgreater}=2, then an extrapolation of the flare distribution to low flare energies may be sufficient to heat the complete observable X-ray/EUV corona. We have obtained long observations of AD Leo with the EUVE and BeppoSAX satellites. Numerous flares have been detected, ranging over almost 2 orders of magnitude in their radiated energy. We compare the observed light curves with light curves synthesized from model flares that are distributed in energy according to a power law with selectable index α. Two methods are applied, the first comparing flux distributions of the binned data and the second using the distributions of photon arrival time differences in the unbinned data (for EUVE). Subsets of the light curves are tested individually, and the quiescent flux has optionally been treated as a superposition of flares from the same flare distribution. We find acceptable α values between 2.0 and 2.5 for the EUVE DS and the BeppoSAX LECS data. Some variation is found depending on whether or not a strong and long-lasting flare occurring in the EUVE data is included. The BeppoSAX MECS data indicate a somewhat shallower energy distribution (smaller α) than the simultaneously observed LECS data, which is attributed to the harder range of sensitivity of the MECS detector and the increasing peak temperatures of flares with increasing total (radiative) energy. The results suggest that flares can play an important role in the energy release of this active corona. We discuss caveats related to time variability, total energy, and multiple power-law distributions. Studying the limiting case of a corona that is entirely heated by a population of flares, we derive an expression for the time-averaged coronal differential emission measure distribution (DEM) that can be used as a diagnostic for the flare energy distribution. The shape of the analytical DEM agrees with previously published DEMs from observations of active stars.},

Every image of a flaring observation was examined by eye and with a point-spread function-matching and image subtraction tool to guard against false positives. Flaring is found to be strongly correlated with the appearance of Hα in emission in the quiet spectrum. Of the 99 flare stars that have spectra, we classify eight as relatively inactive. The flaring fraction is found to increase strongly in stars with redder colors during quiescence, which can be attributed to the increasing flare visibility and increasing active fraction for redder stars. The flaring fraction is strongly correlated with {\textbar}Z{\textbar} distance such that most stars that flare are within 300 pc of the Galactic plane. We derive flare u-band luminosities and find that the most luminous flares occur on the earlier-type m dwarfs. Our best estimate of the lower limit on the flaring rate (averaged over Stripe 82) for flares with Δu {\textgreater}= 0.7 mag on stars with u {\textless} 22 is 1.3 flares hr-1 deg-2 but can vary significantly with the line of sight.

We discuss the photometric precision achieved on timescales relevant to transit detection for data obtained in the 33.5 day long Quarter 1 (Q1) observations that ended 2009 June 15. The lower envelope of the photometric precision obtained at various timescales is consistent with expected random noise sources, indicating that Kepler has the capability to fulfill its mission. The Kepler light curves exhibit high precision over a large dynamic range, which will surely permit their use for a large variety of investigations in addition to finding and characterizing planets. We discuss the temporal characteristics of both the raw flux time series and the systematic error-corrected flux time series produced by the Kepler Science Pipeline, and give examples illustrating Kepler's large dynamic range and the variety of light curves obtained from the Q1 observations.},

	abstract = {We go through the many considerations involved in fitting a model to data, using as an example the fit of a straight line to a set of points in a two-dimensional plane. Standard weighted least-squares fitting is only appropriate when there is a dimension along which the data points have negligible uncertainties, and another along which all the uncertainties can be described by Gaussians of known variance; these conditions are rarely met in practice. We consider cases of general, heterogeneous, and arbitrarily covariant two-dimensional uncertainties, and situations in which there are bad data (large outliers), unknown uncertainties, and unknown but expected intrinsic scatter in the linear relationship being fit. Above all we emphasize the importance of having a "generative model" for the data, even an approximate one. Once there is a generative model, the subsequent fitting is non-arbitrary because the model permits direct computation of the likelihood of the parameters or the posterior probability distribution. Construction of a posterior probability distribution is indispensible if there are "nuisance parameters" to marginalize away.},

	abstract = {We present a sample of 824 solar and late-type stars with X-ray luminosities and rotation periods. This is used to study the relationship between rotation and stellar activity and derive a new estimate of the convective turnover time. From an unbiased subset of this sample the power-law slope of the unsaturated regime, LX /L bolvpropRoβ, is fit as β = -2.70 ± 0.13. This is inconsistent with the canonical β = -2 slope to a confidence of 5σ, and argues for an additional term in the dynamo number equation. From a simple scaling analysis this implies ΔΩ/ΩvpropΩ0.7, i.e., the differential rotation of solar-type stars gradually declines as they spin down. Supersaturation is observed for the fastest rotators in our sample and its parametric dependencies are explored. Significant correlations are found with both the corotation radius and the excess polar updraft, the latter theory providing a stronger dependence and being supported by other observations. We estimate mass-dependent empirical thresholds for saturation and supersaturation and map out three regimes of coronal emission. Late F-type stars are shown never to pass through the saturated regime, passing straight from supersaturated to unsaturated X-ray emission. The theoretical threshold for coronal stripping is shown to be significantly different from the empirical saturation threshold (Ro {\textless} 0.13), suggesting it is not responsible. Instead we suggest that a different dynamo configuration is at work in stars with saturated coronal emission. This is supported by a correlation between the empirical saturation threshold and the time when stars transition between convective and interface sequences in rotational spin-down models.},

In addition, we calculate the metallicity-sensitive parameter ζ and identify a relationship between ζ and the g - r and r - z colors of M dwarfs. We assess the precision of our spectral types (which were assigned by individual examination), review the bulk attributes of the sample, and examine the magnetic activity properties of M dwarfs, in particular those traced by the higher order Balmer transitions. Our catalog is cross-matched to Two Micron All Sky Survey infrared data, and contains photometric distances for each star. Finally, we identify eight new late-type M dwarfs that are possibly within 25 pc of the Sun.

Similar flares have been observed on many stars, with larger `superflares' seen on a variety of stars, some of which are rapidly rotating and some of which are of ordinary solar type. The small number of superflares observed on solar-type stars has hitherto precluded a detailed study of them. Here we report observations of 365 superflares, including some from slowly rotating solar-type stars, from about 83,000 stars observed over 120 days. Quasi-periodic brightness modulations observed in the solar-type stars suggest that they have much larger starspots than does the Sun. The maximum energy of the flare is not correlated with the stellar rotation period, but the data suggest that superflares occur more frequently on rapidly rotating stars. It has been proposed that hot Jupiters may be important in the generation of superflares on solar-type stars, but none have been discovered around the stars that we have studied, indicating that hot Jupiters associated with superflares are rare.},

Each of the {\textasciitilde}38,000 M dwarfs in the SDSS low-mass star spectroscopic sample of West et al. was observed several times (usually 3-5) in exposures that were typically 9-25 minutes in duration. Our criteria allowed us to identify flares that exhibit very strong Hα and Hβ emission-line strength and/or significant variability in those lines throughout the course of the exposures. The flares we identified have characteristics consistent with flares observed by classical spectroscopic monitoring. The flare duty cycle for the objects in our sample is found to increase from 0.02\% for early M dwarfs to 3\% for late M dwarfs. We find that the flare duty cycle is larger in the population near the Galactic plane and that the flare stars are more spatially restricted than the magnetically active but non-flaring stars. This suggests that flare frequency may be related to stellar age (younger stars are more likely to flare) and that the flare stars are younger than the mean active population.},

	abstract = {Analysis of a database of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated flares over the period 1996-2007 finds well-behaved power-law relationships between the 1-8 Å flare X-ray fluence and CME mass and kinetic energy. We extrapolate these relationships to lower and higher flare energies to estimate the mass and energy loss due to CMEs from stellar coronae, assuming that the observed X-ray emission of the latter is dominated by flares with a frequency as a function of energy dn/dE = kE -α. For solar-like stars at saturated levels of X-ray activity, the implied losses depend fairly weakly on the assumed value of α and are very large: {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}∼ 5× 10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\} M\_⊙ yr-1 and {\textbackslash}dot\{E\}∼ 0.1 L\_⊙. In order to avoid such large energy requirements, either the relationships between CME mass and speed and flare energy must flatten for X-ray fluence {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1031 erg, or the flare-CME association must drop significantly below 1 for more energetic events. If active coronae are dominated by flares, then the total coronal energy budget is likely to be up to an order of magnitude larger than the canonical 10-3 L bol X-ray saturation threshold. This raises the question of what is the maximum energy a magnetic dynamo can extract from a star? For an energy budget of 1\% of L bol, the CME mass loss rate is about 5 × 10-11 M ⊙ yr-1.},

We have studied {\textasciitilde}50,000 M dwarfs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 area and 1321 M dwarfs from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) Calibration Scan Point Source Working Database that overlap SDSS imaging fields. We assign photometric spectral types from M0 to M6 using (r - i) and (i - z) colors for every star in our sample. Stripe 82 stars each have 50-100 epochs of data, while 2MASS Calibration stars have {\textasciitilde}1900 epochs. From these data we estimate the observed rates and theoretical detection thresholds for flares in eight photometric bands as a function of spectral type. Optical flare rates are found to be in agreement with previous studies, while the frequency per hour of NIR flare detections is found to be more than two orders of magnitude lower. An excess of small-amplitude flux increases in all bands exhibits a power-law distribution, which we interpret as the result of flares below our detection thresholds. In order to investigate the recovery efficiency for flares in each filter, we extend a two-component flare model into the NIR. Quiescent M0-M6 spectral templates were used with the model to predict the photometric response of flares from u to Ks . We determine that red optical filters are sensitive to flares with u-band amplitudes gsim2 mag, and NIR filters to flares with Δu gsim 4.5 mag. Our model predicts that M0 stars have the best color contrast for J-band detections, but M4-M6 stars should yield the highest rate of NIR flares with amplitudes of ΔJ {\textgreater}= 0.01 mag. Characterizing flare rates and photometric variations at longer wavelengths is important for predicting the signatures of M dwarf variability in next-generation surveys, and we discuss their impact on surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.},

Such studies are crucial considering that the universality of the initial mass function is still a subject of current investigations. Praesepe is an interesting open cluster for the study of the stellar and substellar mass function (MF), considering its intermediate age and its nearby distance. Here we present the results of a wide-field, near-infrared study of Praesepe using the Data Release 9 of the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope Infrared Deep Sky Survey Galactic Clusters Survey. We obtained cluster candidates of Praesepe based on a 3σ astrometric and five-band photometric selection. We derived a binary frequency for Praesepe of 25.6 ± 3.0 per cent in the 0.2-0.45 M⊙ mass range, 19.6 ± 3.0 per cent for 0.1-0.2 M⊙ and 23.2 ± 5.6 per cent for 0.07-0.1 M⊙. We also studied the variability of the cluster candidates of Praesepe, and we conclude that seven objects could be variable. We inferred the luminosity function of Praesepe in the Z and J bands and derived its MF. We observe that our determination of the MF of Praesepe differs from previous studies: while previous MFs present an increase from 0.6 to 0.1 M⊙, our MF shows a decrease. We looked at the MF of Praesepe in two different regions of the cluster, i.e. within and beyond 1°.25, and we observed that both regions present an MF which decrease to lower masses. We compared our results with the Hyades, the Pleiades and α Per MF in the mass range 0.072-0.6 M⊙ and showed that the Praesepe MF is more similar to α Per although they are, respectively, of ages ∼85 and ∼600 Myr. Even though of similar age, the Praesepe remains different than the Hyades, with a decrease in the MF of only ∼0.2 dex from 0.6 down to 0.1 M⊙, compared to ∼1 dex for the Hyades.

In optical colours this will result in the ages for stars younger than 10 Myr being underestimated by factors of between 2 and 3. We show that using observations of standard stars to transform the data into a standard system can introduce significant errors in the positioning of pre-main sequences in colour-magnitude diagrams. Therefore, we have compared the models to the data in the natural photometric system in which the observations were taken. Thus we have constructed and tested a model of the system responses for the Wide-Field Camera on the Isaac Newton Telescope.

Next, we study their properties, such as lifetime, aspect ratio, and spatial extension, in the different models according to the density contrast. We find that these giant cells have a lifetime larger than the stellar period, with a typical longitudinal width of 490 Mm and a latitudinal extension increasing with the radial-density contrast, surpassing 50° in the thickest convective zone. Their rotation rate is much larger than the local differential rotation rate, also increasing with radial-density contrast.

We discuss the distributions of flare parameters (e.g., peak flux) and how these parameters correlate, for instance via the Neupert effect. We also highlight the systematic biases involved in intercomparing data representing many decades of event magnitude.

Eighty of these are cold brown dwarfs with spectral types {\textgreater}=T6, six of which have been announced earlier by Mainzer et al. and Burgasser et al. We present color-color and color-type diagrams showing the locus of M, L, T, and Y dwarfs in WISE color space. Near-infrared and, in a few cases, optical spectra are presented for these discoveries. Near-infrared classifications as late as early Y are presented and objects with peculiar spectra are discussed. Using these new discoveries, we are also able to extend the optical T dwarf classification scheme from T8 to T9. After deriving an absolute WISE 4.6 μm (W2) magnitude versus spectral type relation, we estimate spectrophotometric distances to our discoveries. We also use available astrometric measurements to provide preliminary trigonometric parallaxes to four of our discoveries, which have types of L9 pec (red), T8, T9, and Y0; all of these lie within 10 pc of the Sun. The Y0 dwarf, WISE 1541-2250, is the closest at 2.8+1.3 -0.6 pc if this 2.8 pc value persists after continued monitoring, WISE 1541-2250 will become the seventh closest stellar system to the Sun. Another 10 objects, with types between T6 and {\textgreater}Y0, have spectrophotometric distance estimates also placing them within 10 pc. The closest of these, the T6 dwarf WISE 1506+7027, is believed to fall at a distance of {\textasciitilde}4.9 pc. WISE multi-epoch positions supplemented with positional info primarily from the Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera allow us to calculate proper motions and tangential velocities for roughly one-half of the new discoveries. This work represents the first step by WISE to complete a full-sky, volume-limited census of late-T and Y dwarfs. Using early results from this census, we present preliminary, lower limits to the space density of these objects and discuss constraints on both the functional form of the mass function and the low-mass limit of star formation.},

We also provide revised membership for all previously published Pleiades low-mass stars and brown dwarfs in the past decade recovered in the UKIDSS GCS DR9 Pleiades survey based on the new photometry and astrometry provided by the GCS. We find no evidence of K-band variability in the Pleiades members larger than ∼0.08 mag. In addition, we infer a substellar binary frequency of 22-31 per cent in the 0.075-0.03 M⊙ range for separations less than ∼100 au. We employed two independent but complementary methods to derive the cluster luminosity and mass functions: a probabilistic analysis and a more standard approach consisting of stricter astrometric and photometric cuts. We found that the resulting luminosity and mass functions obtained from both methods are very similar. We derive the Pleiades mass function in the 0.6-0.03 M⊙ range and found that it is best reproduced by a lognormal representation with a mean characteristic mass of 0.20 ± 0.05 M⊙, in agreement with earlier studies and the extrapolation of the field mass function.},

The light curve reveals a sinusoidal modulation with a period of days that we attribute to the rotation of a stellar spot rotating into and out of view. We see no correlation between the occurrence of flares and rotational phase, indicating that there may be many spots distributed at different longitudes or, possibly, that the modulation is caused by varying surface coverage of a large polar spot that is viewed nearly pole-on. The data show no correlation between flare energy and the time since the previous flare. We use these results to reject a simple model in which all magnetic energy is stored in one active region and released only during flares.

The relative radius difference is correlated with magnitude, increasing from a few percent at MI = 7 to greater than 50\% for the lowest luminosity stars in their sample at MI {\textasciitilde} 9.5. Jackson et al. have suggested that a two-temperature star spot model is capable of explaining the observations, but their model requires spot coverage fractions of at least 50\% in rapidly rotating M-dwarfs. Here we examine these results in terms of stellar models that include the inhibiting effects of magnetic fields on convective energy transport, with and without the effects of star spots. We find that a pure spot model is inconsistent with the color-magnitude diagram. The observations of radii versus color and radii versus absolute magnitude in NGC 2516 are consistent with models which include only magnetic inhibition or a combination of magnetic inhibition and spots. At a given mass we find a large dispersion in the strength of the vertical component of the magnetic field in the stellar photosphere but the general trend is that the vertical field increases with decreasing mass from a few hundred Gauss at 0.65 M ⊙ to 600-900 G, depending on spot coverage, in the lowest mass stars in the sample at 0.25 M ⊙.},

	abstract = {We present a spectroscopic catalog of the 1564 brightest (J {\textless} 9) M dwarf candidates in the northern sky, as selected from the SUPERBLINK proper motion catalog. Observations confirm 1408 of the candidates to be late-K and M dwarfs with spectral subtypes K7-M6. From the low (μ {\textgreater} 40 mas yr-1) proper motion limit and high level of completeness of the SUPERBLINK catalog in that magnitude range, we estimate that our spectroscopic census most likely includes {\textgreater}90\% of all existing, northern-sky M dwarfs with apparent magnitude J {\textless} 9. Only 682 stars in our sample are listed in the Third Catalog of Nearby Stars (CNS3); most others are relative unknowns and have spectroscopic data presented here for the first time. Spectral subtypes are assigned based on spectral index measurements of CaH and TiO molecular bands; a comparison of spectra from the same stars obtained at different observatories, however, reveals that spectral band index measurements are dependent on spectral resolution, spectrophotometric calibration, and other instrumental factors. As a result, we find that a consistent classification scheme requires that spectral indices be calibrated and corrected for each observatory/instrument used. After systematic corrections and a recalibration of the subtype-index relationships for the CaH2, CaH3, TiO5, and TiO6 spectral indices, we find that we can consistently and reliably classify all our stars to a half-subtype precision. The use of corrected spectral indices further requires us to recalibrate the ζ parameter, a metallicity indicator based on the ratio of TiO and CaH optical bandheads. However, we find that our ζ values are not sensitive enough to diagnose metallicity variations in dwarfs of subtypes M2 and earlier (±0.5 dex accuracy) and are only marginally useful at later M3-M5 subtypes (±0.2 dex accuracy). Fits of our spectra to the Phoenix atmospheric model grid are used to estimate effective temperatures. These suggest the existence of a plateau in the M1-M3 subtype range, in agreement with model fits of infrared spectra but at odds with photometric determinations of T eff. Existing geometric parallax measurements are extracted from the literature for 624 stars, and are used to determine spectroscopic and photometric distances for all the other stars. Active dwarfs are identified from measurements of Hα equivalent widths, and we find a strong correlation between Hα emission in M dwarfs and detected X-ray emission from ROSAT and/or a large UV excess in the GALEX point source catalog. We combine proper motion data and photometric distances to evaluate the (U, V, W) distribution in velocity space, which is found to correlate tightly with the velocity distribution of G dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. However, active stars show a smaller dispersion in their space velocities, which is consistent with those stars being younger on average. Our catalog will be most useful to guide the selection of the best M dwarf targets for exoplanet searches, in particular those using high-precision radial velocity measurements.},

Our sample consists of 104 magnetic maps of 73 stars, from accreting pre-main sequence to main-sequence objects (1 Myr ≲ t ≲ 10 Gyr). For non-accreting dwarfs we empirically find that the unsigned average large-scale surface field is related to age as t-0.655 ± 0.045. This relation has a similar dependence to that identified by Skumanich, used as the basis for gyrochronology. Likewise, our relation could be used as an age-dating method (`magnetochronology'). The trends with rotation we find for the large-scale stellar magnetism are consistent with the trends found from Zeeman broadening measurements (sensitive to large- and small-scale fields). These similarities indicate that the fields recovered from both techniques are coupled to each other, suggesting that small- and large-scale fields could share the same dynamo field generation processes. For the accreting objects, fewer statistically significant relations are found, with one being a correlation between the unsigned magnetic flux and rotation period. We attribute this to a signature of star-disc interaction, rather than being driven by the dynamo.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of Sun-like stars, similar to our Sun in their surface temperature (5600-6000 K) and slow rotation (rotational period {\textgreater} 10 d), using the Kepler satellite by Maehara et al. (2012, Nature, 485, 478) have revealed the existence of superflares (with energy of 1033-1035 erg). From statistical analyses of these superflares, it was found that superflares with energy of 1034 erg occur once in 800 yr, and superflares with 1035 erg occur once in 5000 yr. In this paper, we examine whether superflares with energy of 1033-1035 erg could occur on the present Sun through the use of simple order-of-magnitude estimates based on current ideas related to the mechanisms of the solar dynamo. If magnetic flux is generated by differential rotation at the base of the convection zone, as assumed in typical dynamo models, it is possible that the present Sun would generate a large sunspot with a total magnetic flux of ∼2 × 1023 Mx (= G cm2) within one solar cycle period, and lead to superflares with an energy of 1034 erg. To store a total magnetic flux of ∼1024 Mx, necessary for generating 1035 erg superflares, it would take ∼40 yr. Hot Jupiters have often been argued to be a necessary ingredient for the generation of superflares, but we found that they do not play any essential role in the generation of magnetic flux in the star itself, if we consider only the magnetic interaction between the star and the hot Jupiter. This seems to be consistent with Maehara et al.'s finding of 148 superflare-generating solar-type stars that do not have a hot Jupiter-like companion. Altogether, our simple calculations, combined with Maehara et al.'s analysis of superflares on Sun-like stars, show that there is a possibility that superflares of 1034 erg would occur once in 800 yr on our present Sun.},

TESS has been selected by NASA for launch in 2017 as an Astrophysics Explorer mission. The spacecraft will be placed into a highly elliptical 13.7-day orbit around the Earth. During its 2-year mission, TESS will employ four wide-field optical charge-coupled device cameras to monitor at least 200,000 main-sequence dwarf stars with IC≈4-13 for temporary drops in brightness caused by planetary transits. Each star will be observed for an interval ranging from 1 month to 1 year, depending mainly on the star's ecliptic latitude. The longest observing intervals will be for stars near the ecliptic poles, which are the optimal locations for follow-up observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Brightness measurements of preselected target stars will be recorded every 2 min, and full frame images will be recorded every 30 min. TESS stars will be 10 to 100 times brighter than those surveyed by the pioneering Kepler mission. This will make TESS planets easier to characterize with follow-up observations. TESS is expected to find more than a thousand planets smaller than Neptune, including dozens that are comparable in size to the Earth. Public data releases will occur every 4 months, inviting immediate community-wide efforts to study the new planets.

To check the consistency of spectral types from the literature, we estimate new spectral types for 52 nearby pre-MS stars with spectral types F3 through M4 using optical spectra taken with the SMARTS 1.5 m telescope. Combining these new types with published spectral types and photometry from the literature (Johnson-Cousins BVIC , 2MASS JHKS and WISE W1, W2, W3, and W4), we derive a new empirical spectral type-color sequence for 5-30 Myr old pre-MS stars. Colors for pre-MS stars match dwarf colors for some spectral types and colors, but for other spectral types and colors, deviations can exceed 0.3 mag. We estimate effective temperatures (T eff) and bolometric corrections (BCs) for our pre-MS star sample through comparing their photometry to synthetic photometry generated using the BT-Settl grid of model atmosphere spectra. We derive a new T eff and BC scale for pre-MS stars, which should be a more appropriate match for T Tauri stars than often-adopted dwarf star scales.

	abstract = {We analyzed Kepler short-cadence M dwarf observations. Spectra from the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m telescope identify magnetically active (Hα in emission) stars. The active stars are of mid-M spectral type, have numerous flares, and have well-defined rotational modulation due to starspots. The inactive stars are of early M type, exhibit less starspot signature, and have fewer flares. A Kepler to U-band energy scaling allows comparison of the Kepler flare frequency distributions with previous ground-based data. M dwarfs span a large range of flare frequency and energy, blurring the distinction between active and inactive stars designated solely by the presence of Hα. We analyzed classical and complex (multiple peak) flares on GJ 1243, finding strong correlations between flare energy, amplitude, duration, and decay time, with only a weak dependence on rise time. Complex flares last longer and have higher energy at the same amplitude, and higher energy flares are more likely to be complex. A power law fits the energy distribution for flares with log EK\_p 31 erg, but the predicted number of low-energy flares far exceeds the number observed, at energies where flares are still easily detectable, indicating that the power-law distribution may flatten at low energy. There is no correlation of flare occurrence or energy with starspot phase, the flare waiting time distribution is consistent with flares occurring randomly in time, and the energies of consecutive flares are uncorrelated. These observations support a scenario where many independent active regions on the stellar surface are contributing to the observed flare rate.},

	abstract = {Open clusters are collections of stars with a single, well-determined age, and can be used to investigate the connections between angular-momentum evolution and magnetic activity over a star's lifetime. We present the results of a comparative study of the relationship between stellar rotation and activity in two benchmark open clusters: Praesepe and the Hyades. As they have the same age and roughly solar metallicity, these clusters serve as an ideal laboratory for testing the agreement between theoretical and empirical rotation-activity relations at ≈600 Myr. We have compiled a sample of 720 spectra—more than half of which are new observations—for 516 high-confidence members of Praesepe; we have also obtained 139 new spectra for 130 high-confidence Hyads. We have also collected rotation periods (P rot) for 135 Praesepe members and 87 Hyads. To compare Hα emission, an indicator of chromospheric activity, as a function of color, mass, and Rossby number Ro , we first calculate an expanded set of χ values, with which we can obtain the Hα to bolometric luminosity ratio, L Hα/L bol, even when spectra are not flux-calibrated and/or stars lack reliable distances. Our χ values cover a broader range of stellar masses and colors (roughly equivalent to spectral types from K0 to M9), and exhibit better agreement between independent calculations, than existing values. Unlike previous authors, we find no difference between the two clusters in their Hα equivalent width or L Hα/L bol distributions, and therefore take the merged Hα and P rot data to be representative of 600 Myr old stars. Our analysis shows that Hα activity in these stars is saturated for \{R\_o\}≤ 0.11+0.02-0.03. Above that value activity declines as a power-law with slope β =-0.73+0.16-0.12, before dropping off rapidly at Ro ≈ 0.4. These data provide a useful anchor for calibrating the age-activity-rotation relation beyond 600 Myr.},

	abstract = {Magnetic fields are hypothesized to inflate the radii of low-mass stars—defined as less massive than 0.8 M ⊙—in detached eclipsing binaries (DEBs). We investigate this hypothesis using the recently introduced magnetic Dartmouth stellar evolution code. In particular, we focus on stars thought to have a radiative core and convective outer envelope by studying in detail three individual DEBs: UV Psc, YY Gem, and CU Cnc. Our results suggest that the stabilization of thermal convection by a magnetic field is a plausible explanation for the observed model-radius discrepancies. However, surface magnetic field strengths required by the models are significantly stronger than those estimated from observed coronal X-ray emission. Agreement between model predicted surface magnetic field strengths and those inferred from X-ray observations can be found by assuming that the magnetic field sources its energy from convection. This approach makes the transport of heat by convection less efficient and is akin to reduced convective mixing length methods used in other studies. Predictions for the metallicity and magnetic field strengths of the aforementioned systems are reported. We also develop an expression relating a reduction in the convective mixing length to a magnetic field strength in units of the equipartition value. Our results are compared with those from previous investigations to incorporate magnetic fields to explain the low-mass DEB radius inflation. Finally, we explore how the effects of magnetic fields might affect mass determinations using asteroseismic data and the implication of magnetic fields on exoplanet studies.},

From the 117,661 stars included, 380 show superflares with a total of 1690 such events. We study whether parameters, like effective temperature or rotation rate, have any effect on the superflare occurrence rate or energy. With increasing effective temperature we observe a decrease in the superflare rate, which is analogous to the previous findings of a decrease in dynamo activity with increasing effective temperature. For slowly rotating stars, we find a quadratic increase of the mean occurrence rate with the rotation rate up to a critical point, after which the rate decreases linearly. Motivated by standard dynamo theory, we study the behavior of the relative starspot coverage, approximated as the relative brightness variation. For faster rotating stars, an increased fraction of stars shows higher spot coverage, which leads to higher superflare rates. A turbulent dynamo is used to study the dependence of the Ohmic dissipation as a proxy of the flare energy on the differential rotation or shear rate. The resulting statistics of the dissipation energy as a function of dynamo number is similar to the observed flare statistics as a function of the inverse Rossby number and shows similarly strong fluctuations. This supports the idea that superflares might well be possible for solar-type G stars.},

We make qualitative arguments as to why the effects of the recent revision in solar abundances accounts for the discrepancy between our findings and the evolutionary models. We also report new color-absolute magnitude relations for optical and infrared colors which are useful for estimating photometric distances.

	abstract = {The spectral energy distribution, variability, and evolution of the high-energy radiation from an M dwarf planet host is crucial in understanding the planet's atmospheric evolution and habitability and in interpreting the planet's spectrum. The star's extreme-UV (EUV), far-UV (FUV), and near-UV (NUV) emission can chemically modify, ionize, and erode the atmosphere over time. This makes determining the lifetime exposure of such planets to stellar UV radiation critical for both the evolution of a planet's atmosphere and our potential to characterize it. Using the early M star members of nearby young moving groups, which sample critical ages in planet formation and evolution, we measure the evolution of the GALEX NUV and FUV flux as a function of age. The median UV flux remains at a "saturated" level for a few hundred million years, analogous to that observed for X-ray emission. By the age of the Hyades Cluster (650 Myr), we measure a drop in UV flux by a factor of 2-3 followed by a steep drop from old (several Gyrs) field stars. This decline in activity beyond 300 Myr follows roughly t -1. Despite this clear evolution, there remains a wide range, of 1-2 orders of magnitude, in observed emission levels at every age. These UV data supply the much-needed constraints to M dwarf upper-atmosphere models, which will provide empirically motivated EUV predictions and more accurate age-dependent UV spectra as inputs to planetary photochemical models.

These data are combined with earlier MKO-system photometry, Spitzer and WISE mid-infrared photometry, and available trigonometric parallaxes, to create a sample of late-type brown dwarfs that includes 10 T9-T9.5 dwarfs or dwarf systems, and 16 Y dwarfs. We compare the data to our models, which include updated H2 and NH3 opacity, as well as low-temperature condensate clouds. The models qualitatively reproduce the trends seen in the observed colors; however, there are discrepancies of around a factor of two in flux for the Y0-Y1 dwarfs, with T eff ≈ 350-400 K. At T eff {\textasciitilde} 400 K, the problems could be addressed by significantly reducing the NH3 absorption, for example by halving the abundance of NH3 possibly by vertical mixing. At T eff {\textasciitilde} 350 K, the discrepancy may be resolved by incorporating thick water clouds. The onset of these clouds might occur over a narrow range in T eff, as indicated by the observed small change in 5 μm flux over a large change in J - W2 color. Of the known Y dwarfs, the reddest in J -W2 are WISEP J182831.08+265037.8 and WISE J085510.83-071442.5.

We show that cool stars produce serendipitous flares energetic enough to be observed in the r-band, and their temporal and peak characteristics are almost the same as those in traditional U-band observations. We also found many large-amplitude flares with inferred \{\{Δ \}\}u 6 \{mag\} in the cluster sample which had been rarely reported in previous ground-based observations. Following the ergodic hypothesis, we investigate in detail statistical properties of flare parameters over a range of energy (Er ≃ 1031-1034 erg). As expected, there are no statistical differences in the distributions of flare timescales, energies, and frequencies among stars of the same age and mass group. We note that our sample tend to have longer rise and decay timescales compared to those seen in field flare stars of the same spectral type and be more energetic. Flare frequency distributions follow power-law distributions with slopes β ∼ 0.62-1.21 for all flare stars and β ∼ 0.52-0.97 for stars with membership information (\{P\}\{mem\}≥slant 0.2).

The A component is separated from the B component by 7'', and the stars are not resolved in the Kepler pipeline processing due to Kepler's large plate scale of 4'' pixel-1. Analyzing the target pixel data, we have generated separate light curves for components A and B using the PyKE pixel response function modeling procedures, and note the effects of CCD saturation and nonlinear response to high-energy flares. In our sample, GJ 1245A and B exhibit an average of 3.0 and 2.6 flares per day, respectively. We introduce a new metric, Lfl /L Kp, to compare the flare rates between stars, and discuss this in the context of GJ 1245A and B. Both stars exhibit starspot features that evolve on long timescales, with the slower rotating B component showing evidence of differential rotation. Intriguingly, the angular separation between the A and B component photocenters decreases during the four years of observations in a manner consistent with a shift in the position of the A photocenter due to the orbit of its unseen M8 companion (GJ 1245C), which is {\textasciitilde}94\% less bright.

As they become older, stars lose mass and angular momentum, resulting in an observed slowdown in surface rotation. The technique of ‘gyrochronology’ uses the rotation period of a star to calculate its age. However, stars of known age must be used for calibration, and, until recently, the approach was untested for old stars (older than 1 gigayear, Gyr). Rotation periods are now known for stars in an open cluster of intermediate age (NGC 6819; 2.5 Gyr old), and for old field stars whose ages have been determined with asteroseismology. The data for the cluster agree with previous period-age relations, but these relations fail to describe the asteroseismic sample. Here we report stellar evolutionary modelling, and confirm the presence of unexpectedly rapid rotation in stars that are more evolved than the Sun. We demonstrate that models that incorporate dramatically weakened magnetic braking for old stars can—unlike existing models—reproduce both the asteroseismic and the cluster data. Our findings might suggest a fundamental change in the nature of ageing stellar dynamos, with the Sun being close to the critical transition to much weaker magnetized winds. This weakened braking limits the diagnostic power of gyrochronology for those stars that are more than halfway through their main-sequence lifetimes.},

	abstract = {Rotation is a directly observable stellar property, and it drives magnetic field generation and activity through a magnetic dynamo. Main-sequence stars with masses below approximately 0.35 \{M\}⊙ (mid-to-late M dwarfs) are fully convective, and are expected to have a different type of dynamo mechanism than solar-type stars. Measurements of their rotation rates provide insight into these mechanisms, but few rotation periods are available for these stars at field ages. Using photometry from the MEarth Project, we measure rotation periods for 387 nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs in the northern hemisphere, finding periods from 0.1 to 140 days. The typical rotator has stable, sinusoidal photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude of 0.5\%-1\%. We find no period-amplitude relation for stars below 0.25 \{M\}⊙ and an anticorrelation between period and amplitude for higher-mass M dwarfs. We highlight the existence of older, slowly rotating stars without Hα emission that nevertheless have strong photometric variability. We use parallaxes, proper motions, radial velocities, photometry, and near-infrared metallicity estimates to further characterize the population of rotators. The Galactic kinematics of our sample is consistent with the local population of G and K dwarfs, and rotators have metallicities characteristic of the solar neighborhood. We use the W space velocities and established age-velocity relations to estimate that stars with P {\textless} 10 days have ages of on average {\textless}2 Gyr, and that those with P {\textgreater} 70 days have ages of about 5 Gyr. The period distribution is dependent on mass: as the mass decreases, the slowest rotators at a given mass have longer periods, and the fastest rotators have shorter periods. We find a lack of stars with intermediate rotation periods, and the gap between the fast and slow rotators is larger for lower masses. Our data are consistent with a scenario in which these stars maintain rapid rotation for several gigayears, then spin down quickly, reaching periods of around 100 days by a typical age of 5 Gyr.},

	abstract = {The ages of the most common stars--low-mass (cool) stars like the Sun, and smaller--are difficult to derive because traditional dating methods use stellar properties that either change little as the stars age or are hard to measure. The rotation rates of all cool stars decrease substantially with time as the stars steadily lose their angular momenta. If properly calibrated, rotation therefore can act as a reliable determinant of their ages based on the method of gyrochronology. To calibrate gyrochronology, the relationship between rotation period and age must be determined for cool stars of different masses, which is best accomplished with rotation period measurements for stars in clusters with well-known ages. Hitherto, such measurements have been possible only in clusters with ages of less than about one billion years, and gyrochronology ages for older stars have been inferred from model predictions. Here we report rotation period measurements for 30 cool stars in the 2.5-billion-year-old cluster NGC 6819. The periods reveal a well-defined relationship between rotation period and stellar mass at the cluster age, suggesting that ages with a precision of order 10 per cent can be derived for large numbers of cool Galactic field stars.},

The evolution of such an atmosphere due to XUV driven evaporation depends on the activity evolution of the host star, which itself depends sensitively on its rotational evolution, and therefore on its initial rotation rate. In this Letter, we derive an easily applicable method for calculating planetary atmosphere evaporation that combines models for a hydrostatic lower atmosphere and a hydrodynamic upper atmosphere. We show that the initial rotation rate of the central star is of critical importance for the evolution of planetary atmospheres and can determine if a planet keeps or loses its primordial hydrogen envelope. Our results highlight the need for a detailed treatment of stellar activity evolution when studying the evolution of planetary atmospheres.},

We construct age-sensitive relationships of luminosity, temperature, and absolute magnitude as functions of spectral type and absolute magnitude to disentangle the effects of degenerate physical parameters such as Teff, surface gravity, and clouds on spectral morphology. We report bolometric corrections in J for both field age and young objects and find differences of up to a magnitude for late-L dwarfs. Our correction in Ks shows a larger dispersion but not necessarily a different relationship for young and field age sequences.

Four distinct mass domains have been identified, which we have tentatively associated with low, intermediate, high, and very high mass main-sequence stars, but which nevertheless are clearly separated by three distinct break points at 1.05, 2.4, and 7 \{\{M\}⊙ \} within the studied mass range of 0.38-32 \{\{M\}⊙ \}. Further, a revised mass-luminosity relation (MLR) is found based on linear fits for each of the mass domains identified. The revised, mass-domain based MLRs, which are classical (L{\textbackslash}propto \{\{M\}α \}), are shown to be preferable to a single linear, quadratic, or cubic equation representing an alternative MLR. Stellar radius evolution within the main sequence for stars with M 1 \{\{M\}⊙ \} is clearly evident on the M-R diagram, but it is not clear on the M-\{\{T\}eff\} diagram based on published temperatures. Effective temperatures can be calculated directly using the well known Stephan-Boltzmann law by employing the accurately known values of M and R with the newly defined MLRs. With the calculated temperatures, stellar temperature evolution within the main sequence for stars with M 1 \{\{M\}⊙ \} is clearly visible on the M-\{\{T\}eff\} diagram. Our study asserts that it is now possible to compute the effective temperature of a main-sequence star with an accuracy of ∼6\%, as long as its observed radius error is adequately small ( 1\%) and its observed mass error is reasonably small ( 6\%).},

	abstract = {We present results from 13776 radial-velocity (RV) measurements of 1278 candidate members of the old (4 Gyr) open cluster M67 (NGC 2682). The measurements are the results of a long-term survey that includes data from seven telescopes with observations for some stars spanning over 40 years. For narrow-lined stars, RVs are measured with precisions ranging from about 0.1 to 0.8 km s-1. The combined stellar sample reaches from the brightest giants in the cluster down to about 4 mag below the main-sequence turnoff (V=16.5), covering a mass range of about 1.34 \{M\}⊙ to 0.76 \{M\}⊙ . Spatially, the sample extends to a radus of 30 arcmin (7.4 pc in projection at a distance of 850 pc or 6-7 core radii). We find M67 to have a mean RV of +33.64 km s-1 (with an internal precision of ±0.03 km s-1) well separated from the mean velocity of the field. For stars with ≥slant 3 measurements, we derive RV membership probabilities and identify RV variables, finding 562 cluster members, 142 of which show significant RV variability. We use these cluster members to construct a color-magnitude diagram and identify a rich sample of stars that lie far from the standard single star isochrone, including the well-known blue stragglers, sub-subgiants and yellow giants. These exotic stars have a binary frequency of (at least) 80\%, more than three times that detected for stars in the remainder of the sample. We confirm that the cluster is mass segregated, finding the binaries to be more centrally concentrated than the single stars in our sample at the 99.8\% confidence level (and at the 98.7\% confidence level when only considering main-sequence stars). The blue stragglers are centrally concentrated as compared to the solar-type main-sequence single stars in the cluster at the 99.7\% confidence level. Accounting for measurement precision, we derive an RV dispersion in M67 of 0.80 ± 0.04 km s-1 for our sample of single main-sequence stars, subgiants and giants with V≤slant 15.5. When corrected for undetected binaries, this sample yields a true RV dispersion of \{0.59\}-0.06+0.07 km s-1. The radial distribution of the velocity dispersion is consistent with an isothermal distribution within our stellar sample. Using the cluster RV dispersion, we estimate a virial mass for the cluster of \{2100\}-550+610 \{M\}⊙ . WIYN Open Cluster Study. LXVII.},

This second paper releases a photometric catalogue, in five photometric bands, of the solar-age, solar-metallicity open cluster M 67 (NGC 2682). Proper motions are derived comparing the positions observed in 2013 at the Asiago's Schmidt Telescope with those extracted from Wide Field Imager@2.2 m Max-Planck-Gesellschaft/European Southern Obseratory images in 2000. We also analyse the variable sources within M 67. We detected 68 variables, 43 of which are new detection. Variable periods and proper-motion memberships of a large majority of sources in our catalogue are improved with respect to previous releases. The entire catalogue will be available in electronic format. Besides the general interest on an improved catalogue, this work will be particularly useful because of: (1) the imminent release of Kepler/K2 Campaign-5 data of this clusters, for which our catalogue will provide an excellent, high spatial resolution input list, and (2) characterization of the M 67 stars which are targets of intense High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher and High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher for the Northern hemisphere radial-velocity surveys for planet search.},

We perform a reference study for late M-dwarfs (MD), BDs and giant gas planet to identify which ultracool objects are most susceptible to plasma and magnetic processes. Only thermal ionization is considered. We utilize the DRIFT-PHOENIX model grid where the local atmospheric structure is determined by the global parameters Teff, log (g) and [M/H]. Our results show that it is not unreasonable to expect Hα or radio emission to origin from BD atmospheres as in particular the rarefied upper parts of the atmospheres can be magnetically coupled despite having low degrees of thermal gas ionization. Such ultracool atmospheres could therefore drive auroral emission without the need for a companion's wind or an outgassing moon. The minimum threshold for the magnetic flux density required for electrons and ions to be magnetized is well above typical values of the global magnetic field of a BD and a giant gas planet. Na+, K+ and Ca+ are the dominating electron donors in low-density atmospheres (low log(g), solar metallicity) independent of Teff. Mg+ and Fe+ dominate the thermal ionization in the inner parts of MD atmospheres. Molecules remain unimportant for thermal ionization. Chemical processes (e.g. cloud formation) affecting the most abundant electron donors, Mg and Fe, will have a direct impact on the state of ionization in ultracool atmospheres.},

Previous studies of stellar rotation in the Hyades relied on targeted observations of single stars or data from shallower all-sky variability surveys. The re-purposed Kepler mission, K2, is the first opportunity to measure rotation periods (P rot) for many Hyads simultaneously while also being sensitive to fully convective M dwarf members. We analyze K2 data for 65 Hyads and present P rot values for 48. Thirty-seven of these are new measurements, including the first P rot measurements for fully convective Hyads. For 9 of the 11 stars with P rot in the literature and this work, the measurements are consistent; we attribute the two discrepant cases to spot evolution. Nearly all stars with masses ≲0.3 M ⊙ are rapidly rotating, indicating a change in rotation properties at the boundary to full convection. When confirmed and candidate binaries are removed from the mass-period plane, only three rapid rotators with masses ≳0.3 M ⊙ remain. This is in contrast to previous results showing that the single-valued mass-period sequence for ≈600 Myr old stars ends at ≈0.65 M ⊙ when binaries are included. We also find that models of rotational evolution predict faster rotation than is actually observed at ≈600 Myr for stars ≲0.9 M ⊙. The dearth of single rapid rotators more massive than ≈0.3 M ⊙ indicates that magnetic braking is more efficient than previously thought, and that age-rotation studies must account for multiplicity.},

	abstract = {Classification of stars, by comparing their optical spectra to a few dozen spectral standards, has been a workhorse of observational astronomy for more than a century. Here, we extend this technique by compiling a library of optical spectra of 404 touchstone stars observed with Keck/HIRES by the California Planet Search. The spectra have high resolution (R ≈ 60,000), high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N ≈ 150/pixel), and are registered onto a common wavelength scale. The library stars have properties derived from interferometry, asteroseismology, LTE spectral synthesis, and spectrophotometry. To address a lack of well-characterized late-K dwarfs in the literature, we measure stellar radii and temperatures for 23 nearby K dwarfs, using modeling of the spectral energy distribution and Gaia parallaxes. This library represents a uniform data set spanning the spectral types ∼M5-F1 (T eff ≈ 3000-7000 K, R ⋆ ≈ 0.1-16 R ⊙). We also present “Empirical SpecMatch” (SpecMatch-Emp), a tool for parameterizing unknown spectra by comparing them against our spectral library. For FGKM stars, SpecMatch-Emp achieves accuracies of 100 K in effective temperature (T eff), 15\% in stellar radius (R ⋆), and 0.09 dex in metallicity ([Fe/H]). Because the code relies on empirical spectra it performs particularly well for stars ∼K4 and later, which are challenging to model with existing spectral synthesizers, reaching accuracies of 70 K in T eff, 10\% in R ⋆, and 0.12 dex in [Fe/H]. We also validate the performance of SpecMatch-Emp, finding it to be robust at lower spectral resolution and S/N, enabling the characterization of faint late-type stars. Both the library and stellar characterization code are publicly available.},

	abstract = {In solar-type stars (with radiative cores and convective envelopes like our Sun), the magnetic field powers star spots, flares and other solar phenomena, as well as chromospheric and coronal emission at ultraviolet to X-ray wavelengths. The dynamo responsible for generating the field depends on the shearing of internal magnetic fields by differential rotation. The shearing has long been thought to take place in a boundary layer known as the tachocline between the radiative core and the convective envelope. Fully convective stars do not have a tachocline and their dynamo mechanism is expected to be very different, although its exact form and physical dependencies are not known. Here we report observations of four fully convective stars whose X-ray emission correlates with their rotation periods in the same way as in solar-type stars. As the X-ray activity-rotation relationship is a well-established proxy for the behaviour of the magnetic dynamo, these results imply that fully convective stars also operate a solar-type dynamo. The lack of a tachocline in fully convective stars therefore suggests that this is not a critical ingredient in the solar dynamo and supports models in which the dynamo originates throughout the convection zone.},

	abstract = {NASA's exoplanet Discovery mission Kepler was reconstituted as the K2 mission a year after the failure of the second of Kepler's four reaction wheels in 2013 May. Fine control of the spacecraft pointing is now accomplished through the use of the two remaining well-functioning reaction wheels and balancing the pressure of sunlight on the solar panels, which constrains K2 observations to fields in the ecliptic for up to approximately 80 days each. This pseudo-stable mechanism gives typical roll motion in the focal plane of 1.0 pixels peak-to-peak over 6 hr at the edges of the field, two orders of magnitude greater than typical 6 hr pointing errors in the Kepler primary mission. Despite these roll errors, the joint performance of the flight system and its modified science data processing pipeline restores much of the photometric precision of the primary mission while viewing a wide variety of targets, thus turning adversity into diversity. We define K2 performance metrics for data compression and pixel budget available in each campaign; the photometric noise on exoplanet transit and stellar activity timescales; residual correlations in corrected long-cadence light curves; and the protection of test sinusoidal signals from overfitting in the systematic error removal process. We find that data compression and noise both increase linearly with radial distance from the center of the field of view, with the data compression proportional to star count as well. At the center, where roll motion is nearly negligible, the limiting 6 hr photometric precision for a quiet 12th magnitude star can be as low as 30 ppm, only 25\% higher than that of Kepler. This noise performance is achieved without sacrificing signal fidelity; test sinusoids injected into the data are attenuated by less than 10\% for signals with periods upto 15 days, so that a wide range of stellar rotation and variability signatures are preserved by the K2 pipeline. At timescales relevant to asteroseismology, light curves derived from K2 archive calibrated pixels have high-frequency noise amplitude within 40\% of that achieved by Kepler. The improvements in K2 operations and science data analysis resulting from 1.5 years of experience with this new mission concept, and quantified by the metrics in this paper, will support continuation of K2's already high level of scientific productivity in an extended K2 mission.},

	abstract = {Young (125 Myr), populous ({\textgreater}1000 members), and relatively nearby, the Pleiades has provided an anchor for stellar angular momentum models for both younger and older stars. We used K2 to explore the distribution of rotation periods in the Pleiades. With more than 500 new periods for Pleiades members, we are vastly expanding the number of Pleiades with periods, particularly at the low-mass end. About 92\% of the members in our sample have at least one measured spot-modulated rotation period. For the ∼8\% of the members without periods, non-astrophysical effects often dominate (saturation, etc.), such that periodic signals might have been detectable, all other things being equal. We now have an unusually complete view of the rotation distribution in the Pleiades. The relationship between P and \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 follows the overall trends found in other Pleiades studies. There is a slowly rotating sequence for 1.1 ≲ \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 ≲ 3.7 and a primarily rapidly rotating population for \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 ≳ 5.0. There is a region in which there seems to be a disorganized relationship between P and \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 for 3.7 ≲ \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 ≲ 5.0. Paper II continues the discussion, focusing on multiperiod structures, and Paper III speculates about the origin and evolution of the period distribution in the Pleiades.},

EVEREST employs a variant of pixel level decorrelation to remove systematics introduced by the spacecraft’s pointing error and a Gaussian process to capture astrophysical variability. We apply EVEREST to all K2 targets in campaigns 0-7, yielding light curves with precision comparable to that of the original Kepler mission for stars brighter than \{K\}p≈ 13, and within a factor of two of the Kepler precision for fainter targets. We perform cross-validation and transit injection and recovery tests to validate the pipeline, and compare our light curves to the other de-trended light curves available for download at the MAST High Level Science Products archive. We find that EVEREST achieves the highest average precision of any of these pipelines for unsaturated K2 stars. The improved precision of these light curves will aid in exoplanet detection and characterization, investigations of stellar variability, asteroseismology, and other photometric studies. The EVEREST pipeline can also easily be applied to future surveys, such as the TESS mission, to correct for instrumental systematics and enable the detection of low signal-to-noise transiting exoplanets. The EVEREST light curves and the source code used to generate them are freely available online.},

The final sample contains 851,168 candidate flare events recovered above the 68\% completeness threshold, which were detected from 4041 stars, or 1.9\% of the stars in the Kepler database. The average flare energy detected is ∼1035 erg. The net fraction of flare stars increases with g - I color, or decreasing stellar mass. For stars in this sample with previously measured rotation periods, the total relative flare luminosity is compared to the Rossby number. A tentative detection of flare activity saturation for low-mass stars with rapid rotation below a Rossby number of ∼0.03 is found. A power-law decay in flare activity with Rossby number is found with a slope of -1, shallower than typical measurements for X-ray activity decay with Rossby number.},

The rotation periods delineate a sequence in the color-period diagram (CPD) of increasing period with redder color. This sequence represents a cross-section at the cluster age of the surface P = P(t, M), suggested in prior work to extend to at least solar age. The current Sun is located marginally (approximately 1σ) above M67 in the CPD, as its relative age leads us to expect, and lies on the P = P(t, M) surface to within measurement precision. We therefore conclude that the solar rotation rate is normal as compared with cluster stars, a fact that strengthens the solar-stellar connection. The agreement between the M67 rotation period measurements and prior predictions further implies that rotation periods, especially when coupled with appropriate supporting work such as spectroscopy, can provide reliable ages via gyrochronology for other similar FGK dwarfs from the early main sequence to solar age and likely until the main sequence turnoff. The M67 rotators have a rotational age of 4.2 Gyr with a standard deviation of 0.7 Gyr, implying that similar field stars can be age-dated to precisions of ∼17\%. The rotational age of the M67 cluster as a whole is therefore 4.2 Gyr, but with a lower (averaged) uncertainty of 0.2 Gyr.},

We compare the flare-binary fraction in different binary morphologies (“detachedness”). The result shows that the fractions in over-contact and ellipsoidal binaries are approximately 10\%-20\% lower than those in detached and semi-detached systems. We calculate the binary flare activity level (AL) of all the flare binaries, and discuss its variations along the orbital period (P orb) and rotation period (P rot, calculated for only detached binaries). We find that the AL increases with decreasing P orb or P rot, up to the critical values at P orb ∼ 3 days or P rot ∼ 1.5 days, and thereafter the AL starts decreasing no matter how fast the stars rotate. We examine the flaring rate as a function of orbital phase in two eclipsing binaries on which a large number of flares are detected. It appears that there is no correlation between flaring rate and orbital phase in these two binaries. In contrast, when we examine the function with 203 flares on 20 non-eclipse ellipsoidal binaries, bimodal distribution of amplitude-weighted flare numbers shows up at orbital phases 0.25 and 0.75. Such variation could be larger than what is expected from the cross section modification.},

The K2 light curves provide not only rotational periods but also detailed information from the shape of the phased light curve that was not available in previous studies. A slowly rotating sequence begins at \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 ∼ 1.1 (spectral type F5) and ends at \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 ∼ 3.7 (spectral type K8), with periods rising from ∼2 to ∼11 days in that interval. A total of 52\% of the Pleiades members in that color interval have periods within 30\% of a curve defining the slow sequence; the slowly rotating fraction decreases significantly redward of \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 = 2.6. Nearly all of the slow-sequence stars show light curves that evolve significantly on timescales less than the K2 campaign duration. The majority of the FGK Pleiades members identified as photometric binaries are relatively rapidly rotating, perhaps because binarity inhibits star-disk angular momentum loss mechanisms during pre-main-sequence evolution. The fully convective late M dwarf Pleiades members (5.0 {\textless} \{(V-\{K\}\{\{s\}\})\}0 {\textless} 6.0) nearly always show stable light curves, with little spot evolution or evidence of differential rotation. During pre-main-sequence evolution from ∼3 Myr (NGC 2264 age) to ∼125 Myr (Pleiades age), stars of 0.3 \{M\}⊙ shed about half of their angular momentum, with the fractional change in period between 3 and 125 Myr being nearly independent of mass for fully convective stars. Our data also suggest that very low mass binaries form with rotation periods more similar to each other and faster than would be true if drawn at random from the parent population of single stars.},

	abstract = {We present a mass-luminosity relation (MLR) for red dwarfs spanning a range of masses from 0.62 \{\{ M \}\}⊙ to the end of the stellar main sequence at 0.08 \{\{ M \}\}⊙ . The relation is based on 47 stars for which dynamical masses have been determined, primarily using astrometric data from Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) 3 and 1r, white-light interferometers on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and radial velocity data from McDonald Observatory. For our HST/FGS sample of 15 binaries, component mass errors range from 0.4\% to 4.0\% with a median error of 1.8\%. With these and masses from other sources, we construct a V-band MLR for the lower main sequence with 47 stars and a K-band MLR with 45 stars with fit residuals half of those of the V band. We use GJ 831 AB as an example, obtaining an absolute trigonometric parallax, π abs = 125.3 ± 0.3 mas, with orbital elements yielding \{\{ M \}\}\{\{A\}\}=0.270+/- 0.004 \{\{ M \}\}⊙ and \{\{ M \}\}\{\{B\}\}=0.145+/- 0.002 \{\{ M \}\}⊙ . The mass precision rivals that derived for eclipsing binaries. A remaining major task is the interpretation of the intrinsic cosmic scatter in the observed MLR for low-mass stars in terms of physical effects. In the meantime, useful mass values can be estimated from the MLR for the ubiquitous red dwarfs that account for 75\% of all stars, with applications ranging from the characterization of exoplanet host stars to the contribution of red dwarfs to the mass of the universe.

	abstract = {Flare events are mainly due to magnetic reconnection and thus are indicative of stellar activity. The Kepler Space Observatory records numerous stellar activities with unprecedented high photometric precision in flux measurements. It is perfectly suitable for carrying out a statistical study of flares. Here we present 540 M dwarfs with flare events discovered using Kepler long-cadence data. The normalized flare energy, as defined by the ratio to bolometric stellar luminosity, \{L\}\{flare\}/\{L\}\{bol\}, is used to indicate the flare activity. We find that, similar to the X-ray luminosity relation, the \{L\}\{flare\}/\{L\}\{bol\} versus \{P\}\{rot\} relation can also be described with three phases, supersaturation, saturation, and exponential decay, corresponding to an ultra-short period, a short period, and a long period. The flare activity and the number fraction of flaring stars in M dwarfs rise steeply near M4, which is consistent with the prediction of a turbulent dynamo. The size of starspots are positively correlated with flare activity. The \{L\}\{flare\}/\{L\}\{bol\} ratio has a power-law dependence on \{L\}\{\{H\}α \}/\{L\}\{bol\}, a parameter indicative of stellar chromosphere activity. According to this relation, a small enhancement in chromosphere activity may cause a huge rise in flare energy, which suggests that superflares or hyperflares may not need an extra excitation mechanism. Through a comparison study, we suggest that flare activity is a more suitable indicator for stellar activity, especially in the boundary region. However, contrary to what is expected, some M dwarfs with strong flares do not show any light variation caused by starspots. Follow-up observations are needed to investigate this problem.},

We have harvested the stellar parameters from the Kepler input catalog and the rotation periods from McQuillan et al. We find several new candidate A stars showing flaring activity. Moreover, we find 653 giants with flares. From the statistical distribution of flare properties, we find that the flare amplitude distribution has a similar behavior between F+G types and K+M types. The flare duration and flare energy seem to be grouped between G+K+M types versus F types and giants. We also detect a tail of stars with high flare occurrence rates across all spectral types (but most prominent in the late spectral types), and this is compatible with the existence of “flare stars.” Finally, we have found a strong correlation of the flare occurrence rate and the flare amplitude with the stellar rotation period: a quickly rotating star is more likely to flare often and has a higher chance of generating large flares.},

Among our sample stars, two have spectral type M6, three are M7, three are M8, and two are L0. Most of our targets are old low-mass stars. We identify a total of 283 flares in all of the stars in our sample, with Kepler energies in the range log E Kp ∼ (29-33.5) erg. Using the maximum-likelihood method of line fitting, we find that the flare frequency distribution (FFD) for each star in our sample follows a power law with slope -α in the range -(1.3-2.0). We find that cooler objects tend to have shallower slopes. For some of our targets, the FFD follows either a broken power law, or a power law with an exponential cutoff. For the L0 dwarf 2MASS J12321827-0951502, we find a very shallow slope (-α = -1.3) in the Kepler energy range (0.82-130) × 1030 erg: this L0 dwarf has flare rates which are comparable to those of high-energy flares in stars of earlier spectral types. In addition, we report photometry of two superflares: one on the L0 dwarf 2MASS J12321827-0951502 and another on the M7 dwarf 2MASS J08352366+1029318. In the case of 2MASS J12321827-0951502, we report a flare brightening by a factor of ∼144 relative to the quiescent photospheric level. Likewise, for 2MASS J08352366+1029318, we report a flare brightening by a factor of ∼60 relative to the quiescent photospheric level. These two superflares have bolometric (ultraviolet/optical/infrared) energies 3.6 × 1033 erg and 8.9 × 1033 erg respectively, while the full width half maximum timescales are very short, ∼2 min. We find that the M8 star TRAPPIST-1 is more active than the M8.5 dwarf 2M03264453+1919309, but less active than another M8 dwarf (2M12215066-0843197).},

The rotation period (5.24 hr) and projected rotational velocity (45 km s-1) confirm 2M0335+23 is inflated (R≥slant 0.20 \{R\}⊙ ) as predicted for a 0.06 \{M\}⊙ , 24 Myr old brown dwarf βPic moving group member. We detect 22 white light flares on 2M0335+23. The flare frequency distribution follows a power-law distribution with slope -α =-1.8+/- 0.2 over the range 1031 to 1033 erg. This slope is similar to that observed in the Sun and warmer flare stars, and is consistent with lower-energy flares in previous work on M6-M8 very-low-mass stars; taking the two data sets together, the flare frequency distribution for ultracool dwarfs is a power law over 4.3 orders of magnitude. The superflare (2.6× \{10\}34 erg) on CFHT-PL-17 shows higher-energy flares are possible. We detect no flares down to a limit of 2× \{10\}30 erg in the nearby L5γ AB Dor moving group brown dwarf 2M0355+11, consistent with the view that fast magnetic reconnection is suppressed in cool atmospheres. We discuss two multi-peaked flares observed in 2M0335+23, and argue that these complex flares can be understood as sympathetic flares, in which fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic waves similar to extreme-ultraviolet waves in the Sun trigger magnetic reconnection in different active regions.},

We find that half of the rapidly rotating ≳ 0.3 \{M\}⊙ stars are confirmed or candidate binary systems. The remaining ≳ 0.3 \{M\}⊙ fast rotators have not been searched for companions, and are therefore not confirmed single stars. We previously found that nearly all rapidly rotating ≳ 0.3 \{M\}⊙ stars in the Hyades are binaries, but we require deeper binary searches in Praesepe to confirm whether binaries in these two co-eval clusters have different P rot distributions. We also compare the observed P rot distribution in Praesepe to that predicted by models of angular-momentum evolution. We do not observe the clear bimodal P rot distribution predicted by Brown for {\textgreater}0.5 \{M\}⊙ stars at the age of Praesepe, but 0.25-0.5 \{M\}⊙ stars do show stronger bimodality. In addition, we find that {\textgreater}60\% of early M dwarfs in Praesepe rotate more slowly than predicted at 650 Myr by Matt et al., which suggests an increase in braking efficiency for these stars relative to solar-type stars and fully convective stars. The incompleteness of surveys for binaries in open clusters likely impacts our comparison with these models since the models only attempt to describe the evolution of isolated single stars.},

We do so through numerical simulations with the ASH code, where we consider stellar convective envelopes coupled to a radiative interior with various global properties. As solar-like stars spin down over the course of their main sequence evolution, such a change must have a direct impact on their dynamics and rotation state. We indeed find that three main states of rotation may exist for a given star: anti-solar-like (fast poles, slow equator), solar-like (fast equator, slow poles), or a cylindrical rotation profile. Under increasingly strict rotational constraints, the last profile can further evolve into a Jupiter-like profile, with alternating prograde and retrograde zonal jets. We have further assessed how far the convection and meridional flows overshoot into the radiative zone and investigated the morphology of the established tachocline. Using simple mixing length arguments, we are able to construct a scaling of the fluid Rossby number \{R\}\{of\}={\textbackslash}tilde\{ω \}/2\{\{\{Ω \}\}\}* ∼ {\textbackslash}tilde\{v\}/2\{\{\{Ω \}\}\}* \{R\}* , which we calibrate based on our 3D ASH simulations. We can use this scaling to map the behavior of differential rotation versus the global parameters of stellar mass and rotation rate. Finally, we isolate a region on this map (R of ≳ 1.5-2) where we posit that stars with an anti-solar differential rotation may exist in order to encourage observers to hunt for such targets.},

Such relationships are being constantly verified and improved based on larger and better samples. The capability of the Strömgren-Hβ photometry to provide reddening-free quantities allows the classification of reddened stars over the entire spectral sequence. However, a detailed consistent tabulation of the uvbyβ quantities for the O-B9 part of the main sequence is currently warranted. We combine spectral types and photometry from the literature to provide a new empirical tabulation of the intrinsic color b - y, color differences c 1, m 1, [c 1] and [m 1] and the Hβ index for main-sequence (luminosity class V) stars of spectral types O4.5 through B9.5 in terms of spectral sub-types. Our survey is based on more than 1400 stars. We use the established c 1 versus b - y intrinsic line and the accepted reddening slopes to obtain dereddened quantities and then calculate their median values as a function of the spectral sub-type. The classification ability of the system in this spectral range is reliable and the photometric quantities are not affected by the stellar rotation.},

This long-term variability can be recovered in photometry from the full-frame images (FFIs), a set of calibration data collected approximately monthly during the Kepler mission. Here we present f3, an open-source package to perform photometry on the Kepler FFIs in order to detect changes in the brightness of stars in the Kepler field of view over long time baselines. We apply this package to a sample of 4000 Sun-like stars with measured rotation periods. We find that ≈10\% of these targets have long-term variability in their observed flux. For the majority of targets, we find that the luminosity variations are either correlated or anticorrelated with the short-term variability due to starspots on the stellar surface. We find a transition between anticorrelated (starspot-dominated) variability and correlated (facula-dominated) variability between rotation periods of 15 and 25 days, suggesting the transition between the two modes is complete for stars at the age of the Sun. We also identify a sample of stars with apparently complete cycles, as well as a collection of short-period binaries with extreme photometric variation over the Kepler mission.},

Using the most complete set of observations of a stellar cycle ever obtained for a Sun-like star, we show how the solar analog HD 173701 exhibits solar-like differential rotation and a 7.4 yr activity cycle. While the duration of the cycle is comparable to that generated by the solar dynamo, the amplitude of the brightness variability is substantially stronger. The only significant difference between HD 173701 and the Sun is its metallicity, which is twice the solar value. Therefore, this provides a unique opportunity to study the effect of the higher metallicity on the dynamo acting in this star and to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed photometric variability. The observations can be explained by the higher metallicity of the star, which is predicted to foster a deeper outer convection zone and a higher facular contrast, resulting in stronger variability.},

	abstract = {Observations of solar and stellar flares have revealed the presence of power-law dependences between the flare energy and the time interval between flares. Various models have been proposed to explain these dependences and the numerical value of the power-law indices. Here, we propose a model in which convective flows in granules force the footpoints of coronal magnetic loops, which are frozen-in to photospheric gas, to undergo a random walk. In certain conditions, this can lead to a twist in the loop, which drives the loop unstable if the twist exceeds a critical value. The possibility that a solar flare is caused by such a twist-induced instability in a loop has been in the literature for decades. Here, we quantify the process in an approximate way with a view to replicating the power-law index. We find that, for relatively small flares, the random walk twisting model leads to a rather steep power-law slope that agrees very well with the index derived from a sample of 56,000+ solar X-ray flares reported by the GOES satellites. For relatively large flares, we find that the slope of the power law is shallower. The empirical power-law slopes reported for flare stars also have a range that overlaps with the slopes obtained here. We suggest that in the coolest stars, a significant change in slope should occur when the frozen-flux assumption breaks down due to low electrical conductivity.},

A maximum likelihood modelling technique, that takes account of observational uncertainties, selection effects and censored data, and considers the effects of differential rotation and unresolved binarity, has been used to find that the average radius of these stars is 14 ± 2 per cent larger at a given luminosity than predicted by current evolutionary models of Dotter et al. and Baraffe et al. The same models are a reasonable match to the interferometric radii of older, magnetically inactive field M dwarfs, suggesting that the over-radius may be associated with the young, magnetically active nature of the Pleiades objects. No evidence is found for any change in this over-radius above and below the boundary marking the transition to full convection. Published evolutionary models that incorporate either the effects of magnetic inhibition of convection or the blocking of flux by dark star-spots do not individually explain the radius inflation, but a combination of the two effects might. The distribution of projected radii is consistent with the adopted hypothesis of a random spatial orientation of spin axes; strong alignments of the spin vectors into cones with an opening semi-angle {\textless}30° can be ruled out. Any plausible but weaker alignment would increase the inferred over-radius.},

Kepler provides data with two time resolutions, i.e., the long-cadence (LC) data with a time resolution of 30 minutes and the short-cadence (SC) data with a time resolution of 1 minute, both of which can be used to study stellar flares. In this paper, we search flares in light curves with both LC data and SC data, and compare them in aspects of the true-flare rate, the flare energy, the flare amplitude, and the flare duration. It is found that LC data systematically underestimated the energies of flares by 25\%, and underestimated the amplitudes of flares by 60\% compared with SC flares. The durations are systematically overestimated by 50\% compared with SC flares. However, the above percentages are poorly constrained and there is a lot of scatter. About 60\% of SC flares have not been detected by LC data. We investigate the limitation of LC data, and suggest that although LC data cannot reflect the detailed profiles of flares, they can also capture the basic properties of stellar flares.},

The observation of M67 by NASA K2 Campaign 5 provided light curves with high enough precision to make this task possible, albeit challenging, as the pointing instability, 75 day observation window, crowded field, and typically low-amplitude signals mean that determining accurate rotation periods on the order of 25-30 days is inherently difficult. Lingering, non-astrophysical signals with power at ≥25 days found in a set of Campaign 5 A and F stars compounds the problem. To achieve a quantitative understanding of the best-case scenario limits for reliable period detection imposed by these inconveniences, we embarked on a comprehensive set of injection tests, injecting 120,000 sinusoidal signals with periods ranging from 5 to 35 days and amplitudes from 0.05\% to 3.0\% into real Campaign 5 M67 light curves processed using two different pipelines. We attempted to recover the signals using a normalized version of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and setting a detection threshold. We find that, while the reliability of detected periods is high, the completeness (sensitivity) drops rapidly with increasing period and decreasing amplitude, maxing at a 15\% recovery rate for the solar case (i.e., 25 day period, 0.1\% amplitude). This study highlights the need for caution in determining M67 rotation periods from Campaign 5 data, but this can be extended to other clusters observed by K2 (and soon, TESS).},

K2SC uses Gaussian Process regression to model position-dependent systematics and time-dependent variability simultaneously, enabling the user to remove both (e.g. for transit searches) or to remove systematics while preserving variability (for variability studies). For periodic variables, K2SC automatically computes estimates of the period, amplitude and evolution time-scale of the variability. We apply K2SC to publicly available K2 data from Campaigns 3-5 showing that we obtain photometric precision approaching that of the original Kepler mission. We compare our results to other publicly available K2 pipelines, showing that we obtain similar or better results, on average. We use transit injection and recovery tests to evaluate the impact of K2SC on planetary transit searches in K2 Pre-search Data Conditioning data, for planet-to-star radius ratios down to Rp/R* = 0.01 and periods up to P = 40 d, and show that K2SC significantly improves the ability to distinguish between true and false detections, particularly for small planets. K2SC can be run automatically on many light curves, or manually tailored for specific objects such as pulsating stars or large amplitude eclipsing binaries. It can be run on ASCII and FITS light-curve files, regardless of their origin.

	abstract = {We present results from a set of numerical simulations aimed at exploring the mechanism of coronal mass ejection (CME) suppression in active stars by an overlying large-scale magnetic field. We use a state-of-the-art 3D magnetohydrodynamic code that considers a self-consistent coupling between an Alfvén wave-driven stellar wind solution, and a first-principles CME model based on the eruption of a flux rope anchored to a mixed-polarity region. By replicating the driving conditions used in simulations of strong solar CMEs, we show that a large-scale dipolar magnetic field of 75 G is able to fully confine eruptions within the stellar corona. Our simulations also consider CMEs exceeding the magnetic energy used in solar studies, which are able to escape the large-scale magnetic field confinement. The analysis includes a qualitative and quantitative description of the simulated CMEs and their dynamics, which reveals a drastic reduction of the radial speed caused by the overlying magnetic field. With the aid of recent observational studies, we place our numerical results in the context of solar and stellar flaring events. In this way, we find that this particular large-scale magnetic field configuration establishes a suppression threshold around ∼3 × 1032 erg in the CME kinetic energy. Extending the solar flare-CME relations to other stars, such CME kinetic energies could be typically achieved during erupting flaring events with total energies larger than 6 × 1032 erg (GOES class ∼X70).},

It is shown that the average rotational velocity is higher among those with Ca ii emission than among those without. Since there is strong evidence that stars with Ca ii emission are younger, on the average, than most solar-type stars, a picture is advanced in which rotation declines with advancing age. It is proposed that magnetically coupled winds, similar to the solar wind, are responsible for this deceleration even after a star takes up residence on the main sequence. The winds are presumably generated only in stars which have subsurface hydrogen convection zones and concomitant chromospheres. Estimates of rotational velocity among solar-type stars in the Hyades and Pleiades are given which confirm this general picture. It is shown that the mean rotation in the Pleiades is highest of all groups considered and averages about 40 km/sec for stars of mass 1.20 o. The time scale for reduction by a factor of 2 of the rotational velocities of Pleiades stars is equal to the age of the Hyades, about 4 X 108 years.},

The simulation models the rise of a buoyant magnetic flux bundle from a depth of 7.5 Mm in the convection zone up into the solar photosphere. The rise of the magnetic plasma in the convection zone is accompanied by predominantly horizontal expansion. Such an expansion leads to a scaling relation between the plasma density and the magnetic field strength such that B vprop rhov1/2. The emergence of magnetic flux into the photosphere appears as a complex magnetic pattern, which results from the interaction of the rising magnetic field with the turbulent convective flows. Small-scale magnetic elements at the surface first appear, followed by their gradual coalescence into larger magnetic concentrations, which eventually results in the formation of a pair of opposite polarity spots. Although the mean flow pattern in the vicinity of the developing spots is directed radially outward, correlations between the magnetic field and velocity field fluctuations allow the spots to accumulate flux. Such correlations result from the Lorentz-force-driven, counterstreaming motion of opposite polarity fragments. The formation of the simulated AR is accompanied by transient light bridges between umbrae and umbral dots. Together with recent sunspot modeling, this work highlights the common magnetoconvective origin of umbral dots, light bridges, and penumbral filaments.},

Although CMEs ejected by our Sun can be directly imaged by white-light coronagraphs, for stars this is not possible. So far, only a few candidates for stellar CME detections have been reported. Here we demonstrate a different approach that is based on sudden dimmings in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray emission caused by the CME mass loss. We report dimming detections associated with flares on cool stars, indicative of stellar CMEs, and which are benchmarked by Sun-as-a-star extreme ultraviolet measurements. This study paves the way for comprehensive detections and characterizations of CMEs on stars, which are important factors in planetary habitability and stellar evolution.},

	abstract = {Internetwork (IN) magnetic fields are highly dynamic, short-lived magnetic structures that populate the interior of supergranular cells. Since they emerge all over the Sun, these small-scale fields bring a substantial amount of flux, and therefore energy, to the solar surface. Because of this, IN fields are crucial for understanding the quiet Sun (QS) magnetism. However, they are weak and produce very small polarization signals, which is the reason why their properties and impact on the energetics and dynamics of the solar atmosphere are poorly known. Here we use coordinated, high-resolution, multiwavelength observations obtained with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) and the {\textbackslash}textit\{Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph\} (IRIS) to follow the evolution of IN magnetic loops as they emerge into the photosphere and reach the chromosphere and transition region. We studied in this paper three flux emergence events having total unsigned magnetic fluxes of \$1.9{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{18\}\$, \$2.5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{18\}\$, and \$5.3{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}\{18\}\${\textasciitilde}Mx.

In this paper, we investigate what would be the best strategy to identify solar-like magnetic cycles and ask which large-scale magnetic field parameters best follow a solar-type magnetic cycle and are observable with the Zeeman-Doppler-Imaging (ZDI) technique. We approach these questions using the 3D non-potential flux transport simulations of Yeates \& Mackay (2012) modelling the solar vector magnetic field over 15 yr (centred on solar cycle 23). The flux emergence profile was extracted from solar synoptic maps and used as input for a photospheric flux transport model in combination with a non-potential coronal evolution model. We synthesize spectropolarimetric data from the simulated maps and reconstruct them using ZDI. The ZDI observed solar cycle is set into the context of other cool star observations and we present observable trends of the magnetic field topology with time, sunspot number, and S-index. We find that the axisymmetric energy fraction is the best parameter of the ZDI detectable large-scale field to trace solar-like cycles. Neither the surface averaged large-scale field or the total magnetic energy is appropriate. ZDI seems also to be able to recover the increase of the toroidal energy with S-index. We see further that ZDI might unveil hints of the dynamo modes that are operating and of the global properties of the small-scale flux emergence like active latitudes.},

Starspot activity produces quasi-sinusoidal light curves whose phase and amplitude vary as active regions grow and decay over time. Here we investigate, first, whether there is a correlation between the size of starspots - assumed to be related to the amplitude of the sinusoid - and their decay time-scale and, secondly, whether any such correlation depends on the stellar effective temperature. To determine this, we computed the auto-correlation functions of the light curves of samples of stars from Kepler and fitted them with apodised periodic functions. The light-curve amplitudes, representing spot size, were measured from the root-mean-squared scatter of the normalized light curves. We used a Monte Carlo Markov Chain to measure the periods and decay time-scales of the light curves. The results show a correlation between the decay time of starspots and their inferred size. The decay time also depends strongly on the temperature of the star. Cooler stars have spots that last much longer, in particular for stars with longer rotational periods. This is consistent with current theories of diffusive mechanisms causing starspot decay. We also find that the Sun is not unusually quiet for its spectral type - stars with solar-type rotation periods and temperatures tend to have (comparatively) smaller starspots than stars with mid-G or later spectral types.},

Our method is calibrated by comparing the strengths of the first few normalized autocorrelation peaks using ensembles of models that have various starspot lifetimes. We find that we must mix models of short and long lifetimes together (in heuristically determined ratios) to align the models with the Kepler data. Our fundamental result is that short starspot-group lifetimes (one to four rotations) are implied when the first normalized peak is weaker than about 0.4, long lifetimes (15 or greater) are implied when it is greater than about 0.7, and in between are the intermediate cases. Rotational lifetimes can be converted to physical lifetimes if the rotation period is known. Stars with shorter rotation periods tend to have longer rotational (but not physical) spot lifetimes, and cooler stars tend to have longer physical spot lifetimes than warmer stars with the same rotation period. The distributions of the physical lifetimes are log-normal for both samples and generally longer in the first sample. The shorter lifetimes in the stars without known periods probably explain why their periods are difficult to measure. Some stars exhibit longer than average physical starspot lifetimes; their percentage drops with increasing temperature from nearly half at 3000 K to nearly zero for hotter than 6000 K.},

The observational data have been obtained with the LRISp polarimeter at the Keck observatory on 2012 August 22 and 23. These data have been compared against synthetic full-Stokes spectra in the bands of the molecules CrH, FeH, and TiO, which have been calculated for a range of the stellar parameters and magnetic field strengths. Making use of χ 2-minimization and maximum likelihood estimation, we determine the net magnetic field strength B (and not flux Bf) of LSR J1835+3259 to ∼5 kG with the help of the Paschen-Back effect in the CrH lines. Our measurements at different rotational phases suggest that the dwarf’s surface might be covered with strong small-scale magnetic fields. In addition, recent findings of the dwarf’s hydrogen emission and the Stokes V signal from the lower chromosphere indicate that its surface magnetic field might be changing rapidly giving rise to flare activity, similar to young dMe dwarfs.

	abstract = {The rotation rates and magnetic activity of Sun-like and low-mass (≲1.4M⊙) main-sequence stars are known to decline with time, and there now exist several models for the evolution of rotation and activity. However, the role that chemical composition plays during stellar spin-down has not yet been explored. In this work, we use a structural evolution code to compute the rotational evolution of stars with three different masses (0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 M⊙) and six different metallicities, ranging from [Fe/H] = -1.0 to [Fe/H] = +0.5. We also implement three different wind-braking formulations from the literature (two modern and one classical) and compare their predictions for rotational evolution. The effect that metallicity has on stellar structural properties, and in particular the convective turnover timescale, leads the two modern wind-braking formulations to predict a strong dependence of the torque on metallicity. Consequently, they predict that metal-rich stars spin down more effectively at late ages (≳1 Gyr) than metal-poor stars, and the effect is large enough to be detectable with current observing facilities. For example, the formulations predict that a Sun-like (solar-mass and solar-aged) star with [Fe/H] = -0.3 will have a rotation period of less than 20 days. Even though old, metal-poor stars are predicted to rotate more rapidly at a given age, they have larger Rossby numbers and are thus expected to have lower magnetic activity levels. Finally, the different wind-braking formulations predict quantitative differences in the metallicity dependence of stellar rotation, which may be used to test them.},

	abstract = {A curious rotation period distribution in the colour-magnitude-period diagram (CMPD) of the Kepler field was recently revealed, thanks to data from Gaia and Kepler spacecraft. It was found that redder and brighter stars are spinning slower than the rest of the main sequence. On the theoretical side, it was demonstrated that metallicity should affect the rotational evolution of stars as well as their evolution in the Hertzprung-Rüssel or colour-magnitude diagram. In this work, we combine this data set with medium- and high-resolution spectroscopic metallicities and carefully select main-sequence single stars in a given mass range. We show that the structure seen in the CMPD also corresponds to a broad correlation between metallicity and rotation, such that stars with higher metallicity rotate, on average, more slowly than those with low metallicity. We compare this sample to theoretical rotational evolution models that include a range of different metallicities. They predict a correlation between rotation rate and metallicity that is in the same direction and of about the same magnitude as that observed. Therefore, metallicity appears to be a key parameter to explain the observed rotation period distributions. We also discuss a few different ways in which metallicity can affect the observed distribution of rotation period, due to observational biases and age distributions, as well as the effect on stellar wind torques.},

This is more than twice the age derived from fitting isochrones to low-mass stars in the CMD with the same models. Much closer agreement between LDB and CMD ages is obtained from models that incorporate magnetically suppressed convection or flux-blocking by dark, magnetic starspots. The best agreement is found at ages of 45-50 Myr for models with high levels of magnetic activity and starspot coverage fractions {\textgreater}50 per cent, although a uniformly high spot coverage does not match the CMD well across the full luminosity range considered.},

Previous studies have shown that activity levels are largely determined by the stellar Rossby number, defined as the rotation period divided by the convective turnover time. However, we currently have little information on the role played by chemical composition. In this work, we investigate how metallicity affects magnetic activity, using photometric variability as an activity proxy. Similarly to other proxies, we demonstrate that the amplitude of photometric variability is well parameterized by the Rossby number, although in a more complex way. We also show that variability amplitude and metallicity are generally positively correlated. This trend can be understood in terms of the effect of metallicity on stellar structure, and hence the convective turnover time (or, equivalently, the Rossby number). Lastly, we demonstrate that the metallicity dependence of photometric variability results in a rotation-period detection bias, whereby the periods of metal-rich stars are more easily recovered for stars of a given mass.},

Such an evolutionary phenomenon should depend on the age of the star-planet system. In this work, we study the temporal evolution of the radius valley using two independent determinations of host star ages among the California-Kepler Survey (CKS) sample. We find evidence for a wide and nearly empty void of planets in the period-radius diagram at the youngest system ages (≲2-3 Gyr) represented in the CKS sample. We show that the orbital period dependence of the radius valley among the younger CKS planets is consistent with that found among those planets with asteroseismically determined host star radii. Relative to previous studies of preferentially older planets, the radius valley determined among the younger planetary sample is shifted to smaller radii. This result is compatible with an atmospheric loss timescale on the order of gigayears for progenitors of the largest observed super-Earths. In support of this interpretation, we show that the planet sizes that appear to be unrepresented at ages ≲2-3 Gyr are likely to correspond to planets with rocky compositions. Our results suggest that the size distribution of close-in exoplanets and the precise location of the radius valley evolve over gigayears.},

Out of 156 of the highest-confidence Taurus members, we find that 81\% are periodic. Our sample of young foreground stars is biased and incomplete, but nearly all stars (37/38) are periodic. The overall distribution of rotation rates as a function of color (a proxy for mass) is similar to that found in other clusters: the slowest rotators are among the early M spectral types, with faster rotation toward both earlier FGK and later M types. The relationship between period and color/mass exhibited by older clusters such as the Pleiades is already in place by Taurus age. The foreground population has very few stars but is consistent with the USco and Pleiades period distributions. As found in other young clusters, stars with disks rotate on average slower, and few with disks are found rotating faster than ∼2 days. The overall amplitude of the LCs decreases with age, and higher-mass stars have generally lower amplitudes than lower-mass stars. Stars with disks have on average larger amplitudes than stars without disks, though the physical mechanisms driving the variability and the resulting LC morphologies are also different between these two classes.},

These data also show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward lower masses. To determine when stalled stars resume spinning down, we use data from the K2 mission and the Palomar Transient Factory to measure \$\{P\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rot\}\}\$ for 58 dwarf members of the 2.7 Gyr old cluster Ruprecht 147, 39 of which satisfy our criteria designed to remove short-period or near-equal-mass binaries. Combined with the Kepler \$\{P\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{rot\}\}\$ data for the approximately coeval cluster NGC 6819 (30 stars with M⋆ {\textgreater} 0.85 \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ ), our new measurements more than double the number of ≍2.5 Gyr benchmark rotators and extend this sample down to ≍0.55 \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ . The slowly rotating sequence for this joint sample appears relatively flat (22 ± 2 days) compared to sequences for younger clusters. This sequence also intersects the Kepler intermediate-period gap, demonstrating that this gap was not created by a lull in star formation. We calculate the time at which stars resume spinning down and find that 0.55 \$\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ stars remain stalled for at least 1.3 Gyr. To accurately age-date low-mass stars in the field, gyrochronology formulae must be modified to account for this stalling timescale. Empirically tuning a core-envelope coupling model with open cluster data can account for most of the apparent stalling effect. However, alternative explanations, e.g., a temporary reduction in the magnetic braking torque, cannot yet be ruled out.},

We find that for stellar flux models corresponding to a range of 0.1 ≲ (Ro/RoSun) ≲ 1.2, the LX/Lbol versus Ro relation matches well the power-law behavior observed in the unsaturated regime of cool stars. Additionally, the magnetic activity cycles captured by the stellar simulations produce a spread about the power-law relation consistent with that observed in cool star populations, indicating that the observed spread may be caused by intrinsic variations resulting from cyclic stellar behavior. The success of our flux transport modeling in reproducing the observed activity relationship across a wide range of late-F, G, K, and M stars suggests that the photospheric magnetic fields of all unsaturated cool stars exhibit similar flux emergence and surface dynamic behavior, and may hint at possible similarities in stellar dynamo action across a broad range of stellar types.},

We find that Φ and LX exhibit a very nearly linear relationship over 12 orders of magnitude, albeit with significant levels of scatter. This suggests a universal relationship between magnetic flux and the power dissipated through coronal heating. If the relationship can be assumed linear, it is consistent with an average volumetric heating rate Q{\textasciitilde}B/L, where B is the average field strength along a closed field line and L is its length between footpoints.

We present new X-ray observations of 19 slowly rotating fully convective stars with rotation periods from the MEarth Project. We use these to calculate X-ray luminosities (or upper limits for undetected sources) and combine these with existing measurements. We confirm the existence of fully convective stars in the X-ray unsaturated regime and find that these objects follow the same rotation-activity relationship seen for partly convective stars. We measure the power-law slope of the relationship between Rossby number (the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time) and the fractional X-ray luminosity for X-ray unsaturated fully convective stars for the first time, and find it to be consistent with that found for partly convective stars. We discuss this implications of this result for our understanding of stellar magnetic dynamos in fully- and partly convective stars.

	abstract = {In principle, a decision between the simplest cosmological models (exploding cases with A = 0, k = +1,0, - 1, or the steady-state case) is possible from the observed velocity-distance relation. Two numbers are needed. These are H and the deceleration parameter, k0/R,H'. This paper discusses the determination of H. Problems connected with the use of cepheid variables as distance indicators are discussed. Because of a finite width of the instability region for cepheids in the color-magnitude (C-M) diagram, intrinsic scatter in the period-color and period-luminosity (PJ relation is expected. The observed period-color relation at median light for field cepheids in our Galaxy shows that Eggen's type C variables are oscillating in a higher mode than cepheids of Eggen type A, B. The data show Q /Qc 1.9. If the region of instability for cepheids in the C-M diagram has a width of A(B - V) = 0.2 mag, then the P-L relation is expected to have a scatter of 1.2 mag. The intrinsically bluest cepheids should be the brightest. Arp's two-color data for cepheids in the SMC confirm these predictions. The brightest stars are discussed as distance indicators for galaxies beyond the local group. It is probable that knots identified by Hubble as brightest stars in more distant resolved galaxies are really H ii regions. From data in M100, the stars appear to be 1.8 mag. fainter than the knots. This correction, together with a correction of 2.3 mag. to Hubble's moduli for galaxies in the local group, suggests a total correction of about 4.1 mag. to the 1936 scale of distances. This gives H 75 km/sec 106 pc or H-' 13 X l0 years, with a possible uncertainty of a factor of 2. The connection of this value of H with the time scale of exploding cosmologies is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have related surface temperature maps, obtained with the Doppler imaging (DI) technique, of LQ Hya with long-term photometry. We compare surface magnetic field maps, obtained with the Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) technique, with contemporaneous photometry, with the aim of quantifying the star's magnetic cycle characteristics. We inverted Stokes IV spectropolarimetry into magnetic field and surface brightness maps using a tomographic inversion code that models high signal-to-noise ratio mean line profiles produced by the least squares deconvolution (LSD) technique. The magnetic field and surface brightness maps reveal similar patterns to previous DI and ZDI studies: non-axisymmetric polar magnetic field structure, void of fields at mid-latitudes, and a complex structure in the equatorial regions. There is a weak but clear tendency of the polar structures to be linked with strong radial field and the equatorial ones with the azimuthal. We find a polarity reversal in the radial field between 2016 and 2017 coincident with an activity minimum seen in the long-term photometry. The inverted field strengths cannot easily be related with the observed spottedness, but we find that they are partially connected with the retrieved field complexity. Comparing to global magnetoconvection models for rapidly rotating young Suns, this field topology and dominance of the poloidal field component could be explained by a turbulent dynamo, where differential rotation does not play a major role (so called alpha{\textasciicircum}2 Omega or alpha{\textasciicircum}2 dynamos), and axi- and non-axisymmetric modes are excited simultaneously. The complex equatorial magnetic field structure could arise from the twisted (helical) wreaths often seen in these simulations, while the polar feature would be connected to the mostly poloidal non-axisymmetric component having a smooth spatial structure.},

	abstract = {We present the discovery and characterization of a giant planet orbiting the young Sun-like star Kepler-63 (KOI-63, m Kp = 11.6, T eff = 5576 K, M sstarf = 0.98 M ⊙). The planet transits every 9.43 days, with apparent depth variations and brightening anomalies caused by large starspots. The planet's radius is 6.1 ± 0.2 R ⊕, based on the transit light curve and the estimated stellar parameters. The planet's mass could not be measured with the existing radial-velocity data, due to the high level of stellar activity, but if we assume a circular orbit, then we can place a rough upper bound of 120 M ⊕ (3σ). The host star has a high obliquity (ψ = 104°), based on the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and an analysis of starspot-crossing events. This result is valuable because almost all previous obliquity measurements are for stars with more massive planets and shorter-period orbits. In addition, the polar orbit of the planet combined with an analysis of spot-crossing events reveals a large and persistent polar starspot. Such spots have previously been inferred using Doppler tomography, and predicted in simulations of magnetic activity of young Sun-like stars.},

	abstract = {We present a study of the variation timescales of the chromospheric activity indicator H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ on a sample of 13 fully-convective, active mid-to-late M stars with masses between 0.1--0.3 solar masses. Our goal was to determine the dominant variability timescale and, by inference, a possible mechanism responsible for the variation. We gathered 10 or more high-resolution spectra each of 10 stars using the TRES spectrograph at times chosen to span all phases of stellar rotation, as determined from photometric data from the MEarth Observatories. All stars varied in their H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission. For 9 of these stars, we found no correlation between H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and rotational phase, indicating that constant emission from fixed magnetic structures, such as starspots and plage, are unlikely to be the dominant source of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission variability. In contrast, one star, G 7-34, shows a clear relationship between H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and stellar rotational phase. Intriguingly, we found that this star is a member of the AB Doradus moving group and hence has the young age of 149 Myr. High-cadence spectroscopic observations of three additional stars revealed that they are variable on timescales ranging from 20--45 minutes, which we posit may be due to flaring behavior. For one star, GJ 1111, simultaneous TESS photometry and spectroscopic monitoring show an increase in H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission with increased photometric brightness. We conclude that low-energy flares are able to produce variation in H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ on the timescales we observe and thus may be the dominant source of H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ variability on active fully-convective M dwarfs.},

We discuss the problematic use of pooling response times across participants, and alternative tests of distributions, the most common being the Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) test. We compare the KS test and the AD test, presenting conclusive evidence that the AD test is more powerful: when comparing two distributions that vary (1) in shift only, (2) in scale only, (3) in symmetry only, or (4) that have the same mean and standard deviation but differ on the tail ends only, the AD test proves to detect differences better than the KS test. In addition, the AD test has a type I error rate corresponding to alpha whereas the KS test is overly conservative. Finally, the AD test requires less data than the KS test to reach sufficient statistical power.},

A still used method by which such data is analysed is to generate a histogram and fit a straight line to it. The parameters obtained in this way can be severely biased, and the properties of the underlying DF, such as its shape or a possible upper limit, are difficult to extract. In this work, we review techniques available in the literature and present newly developed (effectively) bias-free estimators for the exponent and the upper limit. Furthermore, we discuss various graphical representations of the data and powerful goodness-of-fit tests to assess the validity of a power law for describing the distribution of data. As an example, we apply the presented methods to the data set of massive stars in R136 and the young star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. For R136 we confirm the result of Koen of a truncated power law with a bias-free estimate for the exponent of 2.20 +/- 0.78/2.87 +/- 0.98 (where the Salpeter-Massey value is 2.35) and for the upper limit of 143 +/- 9/163 +/- 9Msolar, depending on the stellar models used. The star clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud (with ages up to 107.5yr) follow a truncated power-law distribution with exponent 1.62 +/- 0.06 and upper limit 68 +/- 12 × 103Msolar. Using the graphical data representation, a significant change in the form of the mass function below 102.5Msolar can be detected, which is likely caused by incompleteness in the data.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02861},
	abstract = {Characterizing the distribution of flare properties and occurrence rates is important for understanding habitability of M dwarf exoplanets. The GALEX space telescope observed the GJ 65 system, composed of the active, flaring M stars BL Cet and UV Cet, for 15900 seconds ({\textasciitilde}4.4 hours) in two ultraviolet bands. The contrast in flux between flares and the photospheres of cool stars is maximized at ultraviolet wavelengths, and GJ 65 is the brightest and nearest flaring M dwarf system with significant GALEX coverage. It therefore represents the best opportunity to measure low energy flares with GALEX. We construct high cadence light curves from calibrated photon events and find 13 new flare events with NUV energies ranging from 10{\textasciicircum}28.5 - 10{\textasciicircum}29.5 ergs and recover one previously reported flare with an energy of 10{\textasciicircum}31 ergs. The newly reported flares are among the smallest M dwarf flares observed in the ultraviolet with sufficient time resolution to discern light curve morphology. The estimated flare frequency at these low energies is consistent with extrapolation from the distributions of higher-energy flares on active M dwarfs measured by other surveys. The largest flare in our sample is bright enough to exceed the local non-linearity threshold of the GALEX detectors, which precludes color analysis. However, we detect quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP) during this flare in both the FUV and NUV bands at a period of {\textasciitilde}50 seconds, which we interpret as a modulation of the flare's chromospheric thermal emission through periodic triggering of reconnection by external MHD oscillations in the corona.},

In cool stars with near-surface convection zones, this magnetic activity is thought to be driven largely by the interplay of convection and the large scale differential rotation and circulations it establishes. The highly nonlinear nature of these flows yields a fascinatingly sensitive and diverse parameter space, with a wide range of possible dynamics. We report here on a set of three global MHD simulations of rapidly rotating M2 (0.4 \$M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$) stars. Each of these three models established nests of vigorous convection that were highly modulated in longitude at low latitudes. Slight differences in their magnetic parameters led each model to disparate dynamo states, but the effect of the convective nest was a unifying feature. In each case, the action of longitudinally modulated convection led to localized (and in one case, global) reversals of the toroidal magnetic field, as well as the formation of an active longitude, with enhanced poloidal field amplitudes and flux emergence.},

In 27{\textasciitilde}hr of photometric monitoring, a total of 13 optical flares were detected, each with a total energy of \${\textbackslash}gtrsim 5 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{29\}\${\textasciitilde}erg. The measured event rate of about once every two hours is consistent with those reported previously in radio, X-ray and optical wavelengths for this star. One such flare, detected by both telescopes on 26 April, was an energetic event with a released energy of nearly \$10{\textasciicircum}\{33\}\${\textasciitilde}erg. The two-telescope lightcurves of this major event sampled at different cadences and exposure timings enabled us to better estimate the intrinsic flare profile, which reached a peak of up to 1.6 times the stellar quiescent brightness, that otherwise would have been underestimated in the observed flare amplitudes of about \$0.4\$ and \$0.8\$, respectively, with single telescopes alone. The compromise between fast sampling so as to resolve a flare profile versus a longer integration time for higher photometric signal-to-noise provides a useful guidance in the experimental design of future flare observations.},

Surprisingly many of these Ultra Fast Rotating (UFR) stars showed no evidence of flare activity which would be expected from such rapidly rotating stars. We present results from a spectroscopic survey of UFRs using the Nordic Optical Telescope to search for radial velocity variations which could reveal evidence for binarity. Our sample of 29 sources have a photometric period between 0.1-0.2d, cover spectral classes of M0-4V, and show no evidence for flares. We detect only one source with clear radial velocity shifts, with another two having Gaia RUWE values which suggests they are binaries.

There is no evidence for the companion in our spectra, strengthening the case for a brown dwarf companion. We also examine the folded TESS light curves of all our targets, finding at least two are eclipsing binaries and one which has been contaminated by a spatially nearby \${\textbackslash}delta\$ Sct star. We estimate that around 1/4 of our targets may have been contaminated by short period variable stars. However, the majority of our targets are consistent with being single, low mass stars whose variability is due to starspots. We outline the possible reasons why they are not flare active despite being such rapid rotators.},

	abstract = {Young stars are highly variable in the X-ray regime. In particular, bright X-ray flares can substantially enhance ionization in the surrounding protoplanetary disk. Since disk chemical evolution is impacted by ionization, X-ray flares have the potential to fundamentally alter the chemistry of planet forming regions. We present 2D disk chemical models that incorporate a stochastic X-ray flaring module, named {\textbackslash}xgen, and examine the flares' overall chemical impact compared to models that assume a constant X-ray flux. We examine the impact of 500 years of flaring events and find global chemical changes on both short time scales (days) in response to discrete flaring events and long time-scales (centuries) in response to the cumulative impact of many flares. Individual X-ray flares most strongly affect small gas-phase cations, where a single flare can temporarily enhance the abundance of species such as H\$\_3{\textasciicircum}+\$, HCO\${\textasciicircum}+\$, CH\$\_3{\textasciicircum}+\$, and C\${\textasciicircum}+\$. We find that flares can also drive chemistry out of "steady state" over longer time periods, where the disk-integrated abundance of some species, such as O and O\$\_2\$, changes by a few percent over the 500 year model. We also explore whether the specific history of X-ray flaring events (randomly drawn but from the same energy distribution) impacts the chemical evolution and find that it does not. Finally, we examine the impact of X-ray flares on the electron fraction. While most molecules modeled are not highly sensitive to flares, certain species, including observable molecules, are very reactive to the dynamic environment of a young star.},

A number of automated methods are available to calculate the frequency of maximum acoustic power (\${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max\}\}\$) and the frequency separation between overtone modes (\${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}nu\$) from the power spectra of red giants. However, filtering through the results requires either manual vetting, elaborate averaging across multiple methods, or sharp cuts in certain parameters to ensure robust samples of stars free of outliers. Given the importance of ensemble studies for Galactic archaeology and the surge in data availability, faster methods for obtaining reliable asteroseismic parameters are desirable. We present a neural network classifier that vets \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}nu\$ by combining multiple features from the visual \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}nu\$ vetting process. Our classifier is able to analyse large numbers of stars determining whether their measured \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}nu\$ are reliable thus delivering clean samples of oscillating stars with minimal effort. Our classifier is independent of the method used to obtain \${\textbackslash}nu\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{max\}\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}nu\$, and therefore can be applied as a final step to any such method. Tests of our classifier's performance on manually vetted \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}nu\$ measurements reach an accuracy of 95\%.

	abstract = {Stellar radial migration plays an important role in reshaping a galaxy's structure and the radial distribution of stellar population properties. In this work, we revisit reported observational evidence for radial migration and quantify its strength using the age--[Fe/H] distribution of stars across the Milky Way with APOGEE data. We find a broken age--[Fe/H] relation in the Galactic disc at \$r{\textgreater}6\$ kpc, with a more pronounced break at larger radii. To quantify the strength of radial migration, we assume stars born at each radius have a unique age and metallicity, and then decompose the metallicity distribution function (MDF) of mono-age young populations into different Gaussian components that originated from various birth radii at \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm birth\}{\textless}13\$ kpc. We find that, at ages of 2 and 3 Gyr, roughly half the stars were formed within 1 kpc of their present radius, and very few stars (\${\textless}5\$\%) were formed more than 4 kpc away from their present radius. These results suggest limited short distance radial migration and inefficient long distance migration in the Milky Way during the last 3 Gyr. In the very outer disc beyond 15{\textasciitilde}kpc, the observed age--[Fe/H] distribution is consistent with the prediction of pure radial migration from smaller radii, suggesting a migration origin of the very outer disc. We also estimate intrinsic metallicity gradients at ages of 2 and 3 Gyr of \$-0.061\$ dex kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ and \$-0.063\$ dex kpc\${\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$, respectively.},

The spot coverage is proportional to tn where n = -0.37 ± 0.16, also statistically consistent with a Skumanich-like t-1/2 decay of starspot coverage with age. We apply two techniques to estimate the spot coverage of young exoplanet-hosting stars likely to be targeted for transmission spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope, and estimate the bias in exoplanet radius measurements due to varying starspot coverage.},

	abstract = {X-ray observations of star-planet systems are important to grow our understanding of exoplanets; these observation allow for studies of photoevaporation of the exoplanetary atmosphere, and in some cases even estimations of the size of the outer planetary atmosphere. The German-Russian eROSITA instrument onboard the SRG (Spectrum Roentgen Gamma) mission is performing the first all-sky X-ray survey since the 1990s, and provides X-ray fluxes and spectra of exoplanet host stars over a much larger volume than was accessible before. Using new eROSITA data as well as archival data from XMM-Newton, Chandra and ROSAT we estimate mass loss rates of exoplanets under an energy-limited escape scenario, and identify several exoplanets with strong X-ray irradiation and expected mass-loss that are amenable to follow-up observations at other wavelengths. We model sample spectra using a toy model of an exoplanetary atmosphere to predict what exoplanet transit observations with future X-ray missions such as Athena will look like, and estimate the observable X-ray transmission spectrum for a typical Hot Jupiter-type exoplanet.},

In particular, we implement different stellar activity evolution tracks over time. Our setup allows for a prediction of whether a planet can hold on to a significant fraction of its atmosphere, or fully evaporates, leaving behind only the bare rocky core. The user supplies information about the star-planet system of interest, which includes planetary and host star parameters, as well as the star's rotational and thus activity evolution.

	abstract = {After providing an overview of solar activity as measured by the sunspot number (SSN) and space weather events during solar cycles (SCs) 21-24, we focus on the weak solar activity in SC 24. The weak solar activity reduces the number of energetic eruptions from the Sun and hence the number of space weather events. The speeds of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), interplanetary (IP) shocks, and the background solar wind all declined in SC 24. One of the main heliospheric consequences of weak solar activity is the reduced total (magnetic + gas) pressure, magnetic field strength, and Alfv{\textbackslash}'en speed. There are three groups of phenomena that decline to different degrees in SC 24 relative to the corresponding ones in SC 23: (i) those that decline more than SSN does, (ii) those that decline like SSN, and (iii) those that decline less than SSN does. The decrease in the number of severe space weather events such as high-energy solar energetic particle (SEP) events and intense geomagnetic storms is deeper than the decline in SSN. CMEs expand anomalously and hence their magnetic content is diluted resulting in weaker geomagnetic storms. The reduction in the number of intense geomagnetic storms caused by corotating interaction regions is also drastic. The diminished heliospheric magnetic field in SC 24 reduces the efficiency of particle acceleration, resulting in fewer high-energy SEP events. The numbers of IP type II radio bursts, IP socks, and high-intensity energetic storm particle events closely follow the number of fast and wide CMEs (and approximately SSN). The number of halo CMEs in SC 24 declines less than SSN does, mainly due to the weak heliospheric state. Phenomena such as IP CMEs and magnetic clouds related to frontside halos also do not decline significantly. The mild space weather is likely to continue in SC 25, whose strength has been predicted to be not too different from that of SC 24.},

The stars used in this work are selected from the superblink proper motion catalog of nearby M dwarfs. We study the 135 stars with both a detection in the first eROSITA survey (eRASS1) and a rotation period measurement from TESS jointly with the sample of 197 superblink M dwarfs re-adapted from our previous work. We fit the activity-rotation relation for stars with rotation periods shorter than {\textasciitilde}10 d (saturated regime) using three mass bins. The surprising positive slope for stars in our lowest mass bin (\$M\_\{{\textbackslash}star\} {\textbackslash}leq 0.4 \{{\textbackslash}rm M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$) is due to a paucity of stars with intermediate rotation periods ({\textasciitilde} 1-10 d), probably caused by fast period evolution. The much higher fraction of eRASS1 detections compared to stars that have also rotation periods from TESS shows that eROSITA is also sensitive for slower rotating M dwarfs that are in the unsaturated regime with periods inaccessible to TESS.},

	abstract = {Precise measurements of exoplanets radii are of key importance for our understanding of the origin and nature of these objects. Measurement of the planet radii using the transit method have reached a precision that the effects of stellar surface features have to be taken into account. While the effects from spots have already been studied in detail, our knowledge of the effects caused by faculae is still limited. This is particularly the case for M-stars. Faculae can pose a problem if they are inhomogeneously distributed on the stellar surface. Using the eclipse mapping method, we study the distribution of the faculae on the surface of GJ1214 using the CaIIH\&K lines as tracers. In order to assess the homogeneity of the distribution in a quantitative way, we introduce the inhomogeneity factor IHF. IHF is 0\% if the distribution is homogeneous, positive, if the plage regions are preferentially located along the path of the planet, and negative, if they are preferentially located outside the path of the planet. For GJ1214, we derive a rather small value of IHF=7.7-7.7+12.0\%. We discuss the relevance of this result in the context of the PLATO and ARIEL missions.},

	abstract = {We present a survey for photometric variability in young, low-mass brown dwarfs with the Spitzer Space Telescope. The 23 objects in our sample show robust signatures of youth and share properties with directly-imaged exoplanets. We present three new young objects: 2MASS J03492367\$+\$0635078, 2MASS J09512690 \$-\$8023553 and 2MASS J07180871\$-\$6415310. We detect variability in 13 young objects, and find that young brown dwarfs are highly likely to display variability across the L2--T4 spectral type range. In contrast, the field dwarf variability occurrence rate drops for spectral types \${\textgreater}\$L9. We examine the variability amplitudes of young objects and find an enhancement in maximum amplitudes compared to field dwarfs. We speculate that the observed range of amplitudes within a spectral type may be influenced by secondary effects such as viewing inclination and/or rotation period. We combine our new rotation periods with the literature to investigate the effects of mass on angular momentum evolution. While high mass brown dwarfs (\${\textgreater}30 M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Jup\}\}\$) spin up over time, the same trend is not apparent for lower mass objects (\${\textless}30 M\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{Jup\}\}\$), likely due to the small number of measured periods for old, low-mass objects. The rotation periods of companion brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects are consistent with those of isolated objects with similar ages and masses, suggesting similar angular momentum histories. Within the AB Doradus group, we find a high variability occurrence rate and evidence for common angular momentum evolution. The results are encouraging for future variability searches in directly-imaged exoplanets with facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope and 30-meter telescopes.},

Using HST/STIS, we measure a transit depth of \$11.1 {\textbackslash}pm 1.5\$\% in the blue wing and \$8 {\textbackslash}pm 3\$\% in the red. This signal is unlikely to be due to stellar variability, but should be confirmed by an upcoming second visit with HST. We do not detect Lyman \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ absorption from the inner planet, a smaller \$R=2.15 R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ mini Neptune on a 7.1 d orbit. We use Keck/NIRSPEC to place an upper limit of 0.5\% on helium absorption for both planets. We measure the host star's X-ray spectrum and FUV flux with XMM-Newton, and model the outflow from both planets using a 3D hydrodynamic code. This model provides a reasonable match to the light curve in the blue wing of the Lyman \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line and the helium non-detection for planet c, although it does not explain the tentative red wing absorption or reproduce the excess absorption spectrum in detail. Its predictions of strong Lyman \${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and helium absorption from b are ruled out by the observations. This model predicts a much shorter mass loss timescale for planet b, suggesting that b and c are fundamentally different: while the latter still retains its hydrogen/helium envelope, the former has likely lost its primordial atmosphere.},

Contrary to previous expectations, we find that the two outer Jupiter-size planets will not be affected by any evaporation on Gyr time scales, and the same occurs for the two smaller inner planets, unless their true masses are lower than \${\textbackslash}sim 40\$ M\$\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$.

	abstract = {Solar Cycle 19 was probably the greatest solar cycle over the last four centuries and significantly disrupted the solar-terrestrial environments with a number of solar eruptions and resultant geomagnetic storms. At its peak, the International Geophysical Year (IGY: 1957 -- 1958) was organised by international collaborations and benefitted scientific developments, capturing multiple unique extreme space weather events including the third and fourth greatest geomagnetic storms in the space age. In this article, we review and analyse original records of Japanese auroral observations around the IGY. These observations were organised by Masaaki Huruhata in collaboration with professional observatories and citizen contributors. We have digitised and documented these source documents, which comprise significant auroral displays in March 1957 (minimum Dst = -255 nT), September 1957 (minimum Dst = -427 nT), and February 1958 (minimum Dst = -426 nT). These records allow us to visualise temporal and spatial evolutions of these auroral displays, reconstruct their equatorward auroral boundaries down to 41.4\{{\textbackslash}deg\}, 38.3\{{\textbackslash}deg\}, and 33.3\{{\textbackslash}deg\} in invariant latitudes, and contextualise their occurrences following contemporary geomagnetic disturbances. Our results have been compared with significant auroral displays during other extreme space weather events. These aurorae generally showed reddish colourations occasionally with yellowish rays. Their colourations are attributed to reddish oxygen emission and its mixture with greenish oxygen emission. Overall, these archival records provide the references for future discussions on the auroral activities during the uniquely intense and extreme space weather events.},

So far, most FFPs have been discovered using indirect methods; microlensing surveys have proved particularly successful to detect these objects down to a few Earth masses. However, the ephemeral nature of microlensing events prevents any follow-up observations and individual characterization. Several studies have identified FFPs in young stellar clusters and the Galactic field but their samples are small or heterogeneous in age and origin. Here we report the discovery of between 70 and 170 FFPs (depending on the assumed age) in the region encompassing Upper Scorpius and Ophiuchus, the closest young OB association to the Sun. We found an excess of FFPs by a factor of up to seven compared with core-collapse model predictions, demonstrating that other formation mechanisms may be at work. We estimate that ejection from planetary systems might have a contribution comparable to that of core-collapse in the formation of FFPs. Therefore, ejections due to dynamical instabilities in giant exoplanet systems must be frequent within the first 10 Myr of a system's life.},

	abstract = {Observation of auroras at low latitudes is an extremely rare event typically associated with major magnetic storms due to intense Earth-directed Coronal Mass Ejections. Since these energetic events represent one of the most important components of space weather their study is of paramount importance to understand the Sun-Earth connection. Due to the rarity of these events, being able to access all available information for the few cases studied is equally important. Especially if we refer to historical periods in which current accurate observations from ground-based instruments or from space were not available. Certainly, among these events we must include the great aurora of February 4, 1872. An event whose effects have been observed in different regions of the Earth. What we could consider today a global event, especially for its effects on the communication systems of the time, such as the transatlantic cable that allowed a connection between the United States and Europe since 1866. In this paper we describe the main results of the observations and studies carried out by Angelo Secchi at the Observatory of the Roman College and described in his "Memoria sull'Aurora Elettrica del 4 Febbraio 1872" for the Notes of the Pontifical Academy of new Lincei. This note is extremely modern both in its multi-instrumental approach to the study of these phenomena and in its association between solar-terrestrial connection and technological infrastructures on the Earth.

	abstract = {Pre-main sequence models with inflated radii are needed to simultaneously reproduce the colour-magnitude diagram and the lithium depletion pattern in young open clusters. We tested a new set of PMS models including radius inflation due to starspots or magnetic inhibition of convection, using five clusters observed by the Gaia-ESO Survey, spanning the age range {\textasciitilde}10-100 Myr where such effects could be important. Gaia-ESO radial velocities were combined with Gaia EDR3 astrometry to obtain clean lists of high-probability members for the five clusters. A Bayesian maximum likelihood method was adopted to derive the best model parameters and the cluster reddening and age. Models were calculated for different values of the mixing length parameter (\${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{ML\}=2.0\$, 1.5 and 1.0), without spots or with effective spot coverage \${\textbackslash}beta\_\{spot\}=0.2\$ and 0.4. To reproduce the CMD and the Li depletion pattern in Gamma Vel A and B and in 25 Ori we need both a reduced convection efficiency \${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{ML\}=1.0\$ and an effective spot coverage of {\textasciitilde}20\%. We obtained ages of 18 Myr and 21 Myr for Gamma Vel A and B, respectively, and 19 Myr for 25 Ori. However, a single isochrone is not sufficient to account for the Li dispersion, and an increasing level of spot coverage as mass decreases seems to be required. The older clusters (NGC2451B at 30 Myr, NGC2547 at 35 Myr, and NGC2516 at 138 Myr) are consistent with standard models (\${\textbackslash}alpha\_\{ML\}=2.0\$ and no spots) except at low masses: a 20\% spot coverage seems to reproduce the sequence of M-type stars better and might explain the observed abundance spread. The quality of Gaia-ESO data combined with Gaia allows us to gain important insights on PMS evolution. Models including starspots can provide a consistent explanation of the cluster sequences and Li abundances of young clusters, although a range of starspot coverage is required to fully reproduce the data.},

In turn, stellar winds are faster and denser for young stars compared to evolved main-sequence stars. Their interaction with escaping planetary atmospheres can substantially affect atmospheric mass loss rates, as well as the observable signatures of escaping atmospheres, with both effects expected to occur differently for young and evolved planets. We perform a comparative study of two systems around stars of similar masses but very different ages (50{\textasciitilde}Myr and 9{\textasciitilde}Gyr): TOI-942 and TOI-421. Both stars host two sub-Neptune-like planets at similar orbits and in similar mass ranges, which allows a direct comparison of the atmospheric escape and interactions with the stellar winds in the young and old systems. We perform the 3D atmospheric modeling of the four planets in TOI-942 and TOI-421 systems and make the theoretical predictions of possible observational signatures in Ly-alpha absorption. We find that accounting for the stellar wind interacting with planetary atmospheres is crucial for the interpretation of the observations for young planets. Additionally, we show that a particular energy distribution along the XUV spectra has a minor effect on the atmospheric mass-loss rates, but it is of crucial importance for modeling the Ly-alpha absorption and therefore for interpretation of observations.},

	abstract = {Life on Earth emerged at the interface of the geosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere. This setting serves as our basis for how biological systems originate on rocky planets. Often overlooked, however, is the fact that the chemical nature of a rocky planet is ultimately a product of galactic chemical evolution. Elemental abundances of the major rock-forming elements can be different for different stars and planets formed at different times in galactic history. These differences mean that we cannot expect small rocky exoplanets to be just like Earth. Furthermore, age of the system dictates starting nuclide inventory from galactic chemical evolution, and past, present and future mantle and crust thermal regimes. The bulk silicate mantle composition of a rocky planet modulates the kind of atmosphere and hydrosphere it possesses. Hence, the ingredients of a rocky planet are as important for its potential to host life as proximity to the so-called habitable zone around a star where liquid water is stable at the surface. To make sense of these variables, a new trans-disciplinary approach is warranted that fuses the disciplines of Geology and Astronomy into what is here termed, Geoastronomy.},

The TESS light curve of this star exhibited variations consistent with stars known to possess rigidly rotating magnetospheres (RRMs), so we obtained spectropolarimetric observations using the Robert Stobie Spectrograph (RSS) on the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) at four different rotational phases. From these observations, we calculated the longitudinal magnetic field of the star \${\textbackslash}langle B\_z {\textbackslash}rangle\$, as well as the Alfv{\textbackslash}'en and Kepler radii, and deduced that this star contains a centrifugal magnetosphere. However, an archival spectrum does not exhibit the characteristic "double-horned" emission profile for H\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ and the Brackett series that has been observed in many other RRM stars. This could be due to the insufficient rotational phase coverage of the available set of observations, as the spectra of these stars significantly vary with the star's rotation. Our analysis underscores the use of TESS in photometrically identifying magnetic star candidates for spectropolarimetric follow-up using ground-based instruments. We are evaluating the implementation of a machine learning classifier to search for more examples of RRM stars in TESS data.},

It is still an open question as to whether flares create significant changes in disk chemical composition. We present models of the time-evolving chemistry of gas-phase H2O during X-ray flaring events. The chemistry is modeled at point locations in the disk between 1 and 50 au at vertical heights ranging from the midplane to the surface. We find that strong, rare flares, i.e., those that increase the unattenuated X-ray ionization rate by a factor of 100 every few years, can temporarily increase the gas-phase H2O abundance relative to H by more than a factor of ∼3-5 along the disk surface (Z/R ≥ 0.3). We report that a “typical” flare, i.e., those that increase the unattenuated X-ray ionization rate by a factor of a few every few weeks, will not lead to significant, observable changes. Dissociative recombination of H3O+, H2O adsorption and desorption onto dust grains, and ultraviolet photolysis of H2O and related species are found to be the three dominant processes regulating the gas-phase H2O abundance. While the changes are found to be significant, we find that the effect on gas-phase water abundances throughout the disk is short-lived (days). Even though we do not see a substantial increase in long-term water (gas and ice) production, the flares’ large effects may be detectable as time-varying inner disk water “bursts” at radii between 5 and 30 au with future far-infrared observations.},

We apply an equipartition between the bolometric radiated flare energy and kinetic energy in an accompanying mass ejection, seen in solar eruptive events and expected from reconnection. This allows an integrated flare rate in a particular waveband to be used to estimate the amount of associated transient mass-loss. This approach is supported by a good correspondence between observational flare signatures on high flaring rate stars and the Sun, which suggests a common physical origin. If the frequent and extreme flares that young solar-like stars and low-mass stars experience are accompanied by transient mass-loss in the form of coronal mass ejections, then the cumulative effect of this mass-loss could be large. We find that for young solar-like stars and active M dwarfs, the total mass lost due to transient magnetic eruptions could have significant impacts on disk evolution, and thus planet formation, and also exoplanet habitability.},

	abstract = {Context. The birth environments of planetary systems are thought to influence planet formation and orbital evolution, through external photoevaporation and stellar flybys. Recent work has claimed observational support for this, in the form of a correlation between the properties of planetary systems and the local Galactic phase space density of the host star. In particular, Hot Jupiters are found overwhelmingly around stars in regions of high phase space density, which may reflect a formation environment with high stellar density. Aims. We instead investigate whether the high phase space density may have a galactic kinematic origin: Hot Jupiter hosts may be biased towards being young and therefore kinematically cold, because tidal inspiral leads to the destruction of the planets on Gyr timescales, and the velocity dispersion of stars in the Galaxy increases on similar timescales. Methods. We use 6D positions and kinematics from Gaia for the Hot Jupiter hosts and their neighbours, and construct distributions of the phase space density. We investigate correlations between the stars' local phase space density and peculiar velocity. Results. We find a strong anticorrelation between the phase space density and the host star's peculiar velocity with respect to the Local Standard of Rest. Therefore, most stars in "high-density" regions are kinematically cold, which may be caused by the aforementioned bias towards detecting Hot Jupiters around young stars before the planets' tidal destruction. Conclusions. We do not find evidence in the data for Hot Jupiter hosts preferentially being in phase space overdensities compared to other stars of similar kinematics, nor therefore for their originating in birth environments of high stellar density.},

	abstract = {Magnetospheric clouds have been proposed as explanations for depth-varying dips in the phased light curves of young, magnetically active stars such as \${\textbackslash}sigma\$ Ori E and RIK-210. However, the stellar theory that first predicted magnetospheric clouds also anticipated an associated mass-loss mechanism known as centrifugal breakout for which there has been limited empirical evidence. In this paper, we present data from TESS, LCO, ASAS-SN, and Veloce on the 45 Myr M3.5 star TIC 234284556, and propose that it is a candidate for the direct detection of centrifugal breakout. In assessing this hypothesis, we examine the sudden (\${\textbackslash}sim\$1-day timescale) disappearance of a previously stable (\${\textbackslash}sim\$1-month timescale) transit-like event. We also interpret the presence of an anomalous brightening event that precedes the disappearance of the signal, analyze rotational amplitudes and optical flaring as a proxy for magnetic activity, and estimate the mass of gas and dust present immediately prior to the potential breakout event. After demonstrating that our spectral and photometric data support a magnetospheric clouds and centrifugal breakout model and disfavor alternate scenarios, we discuss the possibility of a coronal mass ejection (CME) or stellar wind origin of the corotating material and we introduce a reionization mechanism as a potential explanation for more gradual variations in eclipse parameters. Finally, after comparing TIC 234284556 with previously identified "flux-dip" stars, we argue that TIC 234284556 may be an archetypal representative of a whole class of young, magnetically active stars.},

Go read Slack, it’s short and important.

If you’re not a slacker, that post might change your life and explain why you
feel like you have no control over your own life despite doing well onalmost all
counts. If you are a slacker, like me, this post gives our philosophy a name and
provides a definition: slack is the absence of binding constraints on behavior.

Zvi’s post is abstract on purpose. I’ll continue his mission by getting more
specific and, of course, by putting a num on it. To the latter purpose, I’ll
modify the definition of slack to make it quantifiable:

Slack is the distance from binding constraints on your behavior.

KEEP YOUR DISTANCE
Slack is a function of many resources. Running out of any single vital resource
is enough to constrain your behavior: make you do something you didn’t want to,
or prevent you from doing something you want. Freedom requires having spare
time, spare money, spare energy, spare weirdness points, available friends etc.
The “slack as distance” formula looks a little something like this:

Slack disappears when the spare capacity of any single resource goes to zero,
regardless of how much of everything else you have. Maintaining slack requires
balancing all the important resources, making sure to shore up the scarcest
resources first.

Their stellar counterparts, presumably involving much larger energies, are expected to play a fundamental role in shaping the environmental conditions around low-mass stars, in some cases perhaps with catastrophic consequences for planetary systems due to processes such as atmospheric erosion and depletion. Despite their importance, the direct observational evidence for stellar CMEs is almost non-existent. In this way, numerical simulations constitute extremely valuable tools to shed some light on eruptive behavior in the stellar regime. Here we review recent results obtained from realistic modeling of CMEs in active stars, highlighting their key role in the interpretation of currently available observational constraints. We include studies performed on M-dwarf stars, focusing on how emerging signatures in different wavelengths related to these events vary as a function of the magnetic properties of the star.

With the support of MHD simulations, we propose the following interpretation: a stream of gas evaporating from the planet is actively and almost steadily accreting onto the stellar surface, impacting at 70\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ -90\{\}{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ ahead of the subplanetary point.},

We have three epochs of MeerKAT observations, where the star is not detected in the first epoch, is detected in the second epoch, and is marginally detected in the third epoch. We cannot distinguish whether the detection is quiescent emission or a transient radio burst. If we assume the radio detection is quiescent emission the source lies somewhat to the right of the G{\textbackslash}"udel-Benz relation; however, if we assume the upper-limit on the radio non-detection is indicative of the quiescent emission then the source lies directly on the relation. Both cases are broadly consistent with the relation. We use archival spectral energy distribution data and new SALT high-resolution spectroscopy to confirm that EXO 040830\$-\$7134.7 is a chromospherically active M-dwarf with a temperature of 4000\${\textbackslash}pm\$200 K of spectral type M0V. We use ASAS, ASAS-SN and TESS optical photometry to derive an improved rotational period of 5.18\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.04 days.

Here we use the system's fragile orbital structure to place robust upper limits on the planets' bombardment histories. We use N-body simulations to show how perturbations from additional objects can break the multi-resonant configuration by either triggering dynamical instability or simply removing the planets from resonance. The planets cannot have interacted with more than \$\{{\textbackslash}sim 5{\textbackslash}\%\}\$ of an Earth mass (\$\{M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$) in planetesimals -- or a single rogue planet more massive than Earth's Moon -- without disrupting their resonant orbital structure. This implies an upper limit of \$\{10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\}\}\$ to \$\{10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$ of late accretion on each planet since the dispersal of the system's gaseous disk. This is comparable to or less than the late accretion on Earth after the Moon-forming impact, and demonstrates that the Trappist-1 planets' growth was complete in just a few million years, roughly an order of magnitude faster than Earth's. Our results imply that any large water reservoirs on the Trappist-1 planets must have been incorporated during their formation in the gaseous disk.},

	abstract = {This paper calibrates how metrics derivable from the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System can be used to estimate the future impact of astronomy research careers and thereby to inform decisions on resource allocation such as job hires and tenure decisions. Three metrics are used, citations of refereed papers, citations of all publications normalized by the numbers of co-authors, and citations of all first-author papers. Each is individually calibrated as an impact predictor in the book Kormendy (2020), "Metrics of Research Impact in Astronomy" (Astron Soc Pac Conference Series Monograph 8, San Francisco). How this is done is reviewed in the first half of this paper. Then, I show that averaging results from three metrics produces more accurate predictions. Average prediction machines are constructed for different cohorts of 1990-2007 PhDs and used to postdict 2017 impact from metrics measured 10, 12, and 15 years after the PhD. The time span over which prediction is made ranges from 0 years for 2007 PhDs to 17 years for 1990 PhDs using metrics measured 10 years after the PhD. Calibration is based on perceived 2017 impact as voted by 22 experienced astronomers for 510 faculty members at 17 highly-ranked university astronomy departments world-wide. Prediction machinery reproduces voted impact estimates with an RMS uncertainty of 1/8 of the dynamic range for people in the study sample. The aim of this work is to lend some of the rigor that is normally used in scientific research to the difficult and subjective job of judging people's careers.},

	abstract = {We simulate possible stellar coronal mass ejection (CME) scenarios over the magnetic cycle of \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Eridani (18 Eridani; HD 22049). We use three separate epochs from 2008, 2011, and 2013, and estimate the radio emission frequencies associated with these events. These stellar eruptions have proven to be elusive, although a promising approach to detect and characterise these phenomena are low-frequency radio observations of potential type II bursts as CME induced shocks propagate through the stellar corona. Stellar type II radio bursts are expected to emit below 450 MHz, similarly to their solar counterparts. We show that the length of time these events remain above the ionospheric cutoff is not necessarily dependent on the stellar magnetic cycle, but more on the eruption location relative to the stellar magnetic field. We find that these type II bursts would remain within the frequency range of LOFAR for a maximum of 20-30 minutes post-eruption for the polar CMEs, (50 minutes for 2nd harmonics). We find evidence of slower equatorial CMEs, which result in slightly longer observable windows for the 2008 and 2013 simulations. Stellar magnetic geometry and strength has a significant effect on the detectability of these events. We place the CMEs in the context of the stellar mass-loss rate (27-48 \${\textbackslash}times\$ solar mass-loss rate), showing that they can amount to 3-50\% of the stellar wind mass-loss rate for \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ Eridani. Continuous monitoring of likely stellar CME candidates with low-frequency radio telescopes will be required to detect these transient events.},

	abstract = {High-energy stellar irradiation can photoevaporate planetary atmospheres, which can be observed in spectroscopic transits of hydrogen lines. For the exoplanet HD189733b, multiple observations in the Ly α line have shown that atmospheric evaporation is variable, going from undetected to enhanced evaporation in a 1.5-yr interval. Coincidentally or not, when HD189733b was observed to be evaporating, a stellar flare had just occurred 8 h prior to the observation. This led to the question of whether this temporal variation in evaporation occurred due to the flare, an unseen associated coronal mass ejection (CME), or even the simultaneous effect of both. In this work, we investigate the impact of flares (radiation), winds, and CMEs (particles) on the atmosphere of HD189733b using three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations that self-consistently include stellar photon heating. We study four cases: first, the quiescent phase including stellar wind; secondly, a flare; thirdly, a CME; and fourthly, a flare that is followed by a CME. Compared to the quiescent case, we find that the flare alone increases the evaporation rate by only 25 per cent, while the CME leads to a factor of 4 increments. We calculate Ly α synthetic transits and find that the flare alone cannot explain the observed high blueshifted velocities seen in the Ly α. The CME, however, leads to an increase in the velocity of escaping atmospheres, enhancing the blueshifted transit depth. While the effects of CMEs show a promising potential, our models are not able to fully explain the blueshifted transit depths, indicating that they might require additional physical mechanisms.},

In the solar case, the largest flares originate from large active regions. In this work, we present a study of the activity of the star Kepler-411, including spot modeling from planetary transits. Our goal was to search for a connection between the area of starspots with the energy of superflares produced by this star. Kepler-411 is a K2V-type star with an average rotation period of 10.52 days, radius of 0.79 R ⊙, and a mass of 0.83 M ⊙, which was observed by the Kepler satellite for about 600 days. Transit mapping allowed for the characterization of 198 starspots with estimates of their radius and temperature. Kepler-411 starspots had an average radius of (17 ± 7) × 103 km and a mean temperature of 3800 ± 700 K. Visual inspection of the light curves of Kepler-411 yields the identification of 65 superflares. The detected superflares lasted from 8 to 260 minutes and their energy varied from 1033-1035 ergs. The power-law index of the flare frequency distribution as a function of energy is (-2.04 ± 0.13) for the flare on Kepler-411. A positive correlation between the area of starspots and the energy of superflares was found when considering the averages taken every 16-35 days, with the highest correlation occurring for averages every 21 days. This timing is probably related to the lifetime of the Kepler-411 spots.},

	abstract = {Magnetic fields provide an important probe of the thermal, material, and structural history of planetary and sub-planetary bodies. Core dynamos are a potential source of magnetic fields for differentiated bodies, but evidence of magnetization in undifferentiated bodies requires a different mechanism. Here we study the amplified field provided by the stellar wind to an initially unmagnetized body using analytic theory and numerical simulations, employing the resistive MHD AstroBEAR adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) multiphysics code. We obtain a broadly applicable scaling relation for the peak magnetization achieved once a wind advects, piles-up, and drapes a body with magnetic field, reaching a quasi-steady state. We find that the dayside magnetic field for a sufficiently conductive body saturates when it balances the sum of incoming solar wind ram, magnetic, and thermal pressures. Stronger amplification results from pileup by denser and faster winds. Careful quantification of numerical diffusivity is required for accurately interpreting the peak magnetic field strength from simulations, and corroborating with theory. As specifically applied to the Solar System, we find that early solar wind-induced field amplification is a viable source of magnetization for observed paleointensities in meteorites from some undifferentiated bodies. This mechanism may also be applicable to other Solar System bodies, including metal-rich bodies to be visited in future space missions such as the asteroid (16) Psyche.},

Applying Gaussian process regressions to the K2 light curves and the near-infrared (NIR) light curves observed with the IRSF 1.4-m telescope, we derive the wavelength dependences of the photometric signals due to stellar activity. To estimate the temporal variations in the photometric variability amplitudes between the two observation periods of K2 and IRSF, separated by more than 2 years, we analyze a number of K2 targets in Hyades that have also been observed in Campaigns 4 and 13 and find a representative variation rate over 2 years of 38\%pm71\%. Taking this temporal variation into account, we constrain projected sizes and temperature contrast properties of the starspots in the stellar photosphere to be approximately 10\% and 0.95, respectively. These starspot properties can induce relatively large differences in the variability amplitude over different observational passbands, and we find that radial-velocity jitter may be more suppressed in the NIR than previously expected.

	abstract = {The alignment of planetary orbits with respect to the stellar rotation preserves information on their dynamical histories. Measuring this angle for young planets help illuminate the mechanisms that create misaligned orbits for older planets, as different processes could operate over timescales ranging from a few Myr to a Gyr. We present spectroscopic transit observations of the young exoplanet V1298 Tau b; we update the age of V1298 Tau to be \$28{\textbackslash}pm4\$ Myr based on Gaia EDR3 measurements. We observed a partial transit with Keck/HIRES and LBT/PEPSI, and detected the radial velocity anomaly due to the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. V1298 Tau{\textasciitilde}b has a prograde, well-aligned orbit, with \${\textbackslash}lambda = 4\_\{-10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+7 {\textbackslash}circ\}\$. By combining the spectroscopically-measured \$v{\textbackslash}sin i\_\{{\textbackslash}star\}\$ and the phtometrically-measured rotation period of the host star we also find that the orbit is aligned in 3D, \${\textbackslash}psi = 8\_\{-7\}{\textasciicircum}\{+4 {\textbackslash}circ\}\$ deg.

This measurements adds to the growing number of well-aligned planets at young ages, hinting that misalignments may be generated over timescales of longer than tens of Myr. The number of measurements, however, is still small, and this population may not be representative of the older planets that have been observed to date.

	abstract = {We present the discovery and characterisation of two transiting planets discovered by TESS in the light curves of the young and bright (V=9.67) star HD 73583 (TOI-560). We perform an intensive spectroscopic and photometric space- and ground-based follow-up in order to confirm and characterise the system. We found that HD 73583 is a young (750 Myr) active star with a rotational period of \$12.1\$ d and a mass and radius of \$ 0.71 M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ and \$0.66 R\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, respectively. HD 73583 b (\$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm b\}=\$ \$6.4\$d) has a mass and radius of \$10 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and \$2.83 {\textbackslash}pm 0.10 R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, respectively, that gives a density of \$2.43 \{{\textbackslash}rm g{\textbackslash},cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}\$. HD 73583 c (\$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm c\}= 18.9\$ d) has a mass and radius of \$9.6 M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and \$2.37 R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$, respectively, this translates to a density of \$3.97 \{{\textbackslash}rm g{\textbackslash},cm{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\}\$. Both planets are consistent with worlds made of a solid core surrounded by a thick envelope. Because of their youth and host star brightness, they both are excellent candidates to perform transmission spectroscopy studies and search for mass-loss signatures. We expect atmospheric mass-loss rates of \$2.4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{10\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm g{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ and \$5.4 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{9\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm g{\textbackslash},s{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\}\$ for HD73583 b and c, respectively. We expect that the detection of evaporating signatures on H and He would be challenging, but doable with present and future instruments.},

	abstract = {We present the TESS discovery of the LHS 1678 (TOI-696) exoplanet system, comprised of two approximately Earth-sized transiting planets and a likely astrometric brown dwarf orbiting a bright (\$V\_J\$=12.5, \$K\_s\$=8.3) M2 dwarf at 19.9 pc. The two TESS-detected planets are of radius 0.70\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.04 \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and 0.98\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.06 \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ in 0.86-day and 3.69-day orbits, respectively. Both planets are validated and characterized via ground-based follow-up observations. HARPS RV monitoring yields 97.7 percentile mass upper limits of 0.35 \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ and 1.4 \$M\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ for planets b and c, respectively. The astrometric companion detected by the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9m has an orbital period on the order of decades and is undetected by other means. Additional ground-based observations constrain the companion to being a high-mass brown dwarf or smaller. Each planet is of unique interest; the inner planet has an ultra-short period, and the outer planet is in the Venus zone. Both are promising targets for atmospheric characterization with the JWST and mass measurements via extreme-precision radial velocity. A third planet candidate of radius 0.9\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.1 \$R\_{\textbackslash}oplus\$ in a 4.97-day orbit is also identified in multi-Cycle TESS data for validation in future work. The host star is associated with an observed gap in the lower main sequence of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This gap is tied to the transition from partially- to fully-convective interiors in M dwarfs, and the effect of the associated stellar astrophysics on exoplanet evolution is currently unknown. The culmination of these system properties makes LHS 1678 a unique, compelling playground for comparative exoplanet science and understanding the formation and evolution of small, short-period exoplanets orbiting low-mass stars.},

One of the best such events was SOL2017-09-10, an X8.2 flare that occurred near the Sun's west limb on 2017 September 10 and produced a WL loop system lasting more than 60 minutes and reaching an altitude higher than 30 Mm. The event was well observed by a suite of ground- and space-based instruments, including the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (SDO/HMI) that captured its off-limb loops in WL continuum near Fe I 6173 A, and the Atmospheric Imager Assembly (SDO/AIA) that observed its ultraviolet (UV) and extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) counterparts. We found quasi-periodic pulsations in the WL and UV emissions at the flare loop-top with a period around 8.0 min. Each pulsation appears to have an EUV counterpart that occurs earlier in time and higher in altitude. Despite many similarities in the WL and UV images and light curves, the WL flux at the loop-top continues to grow for about 16 minutes while the UV fluxes gradually decay. We discuss the implication of these unprecedented observations on the understanding of the enigmatic off-limb WL flare emission mechanisms.},

These trapped interstellar objects might be large enough to rapidly grow into larger planetesimals via the direct accretion of the sub-cm sized dust grains in the protoplanetary disk before they drift in due to gas drag, helping overcome the meter-size barrier, acting as "seeds" for planet formation. They should be considered in future star and planet formation models and in the potential spread of biological material across the Galaxy.},

	abstract = {The characteristic mass that sets the peak of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is closely linked to the thermodynamic behaviour of interstellar gas, which controls how gas fragments as it collapses under gravity. As the Universe has grown in metal abundance over cosmic time, this thermodynamic behaviour has evolved from a primordial regime dominated by the competition between compressional heating and molecular hydrogen cooling to a modern regime where the dominant process in dense gas is protostellar radiation feedback, transmitted to the gas by dust-gas collisions. In this paper we map out the primordial-to-modern transition by constructing a model for the thermodynamics of collapsing, dusty gas clouds at a wide range of metallicities. We show the transition from the primordial regime to the modern regime begins at metallicity \$Z{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-4\} {\textbackslash}rm\{Z\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, passes through an intermediate stage where metal line cooling is dominant at \$Z {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm\{Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$, and then transitions to the modern dust- and feedback-dominated regime at \$Z{\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-2\} {\textbackslash}rm\{Z\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$. In low pressure environments like the Milky Way, this transition is accompanied by a dramatic change in the characteristic stellar mass, from \${\textbackslash}sim 50{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ at \$Z {\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}\{-6\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm\{Z\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$ to \${\textbackslash}sim 0.3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm\{M\_{\textbackslash}odot\}\$ once radiation feedback begins to dominate, which marks the appearance of the modern bottom-heavy Milky Way IMF. In the high pressure environments typical of massive elliptical galaxies, the characteristic mass for the modern, dust-dominated regime falls to \${\textbackslash}sim 0.1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}rm\{M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\}\$, thus providing an explanation for the more bottom-heavy IMF observed in these galaxies. We conclude that metallicity is a key driver of variations in the characteristic stellar mass, and by extension, the IMF.},

	abstract = {One of the grand challenges in heliophysics is the characterisation of coronal mass ejection (CME) magnetic structure and evolution from eruption at the Sun through heliospheric propagation. At present, the main difficulties are related to the lack of direct measurements of the coronal magnetic fields and the lack of 3D in-situ measurements of the CME body in interplanetary space. Nevertheless, the evolution of a CME magnetic structure can be followed using a combination of multi-point remote-sensing observations and multi-spacecraft in-situ measurements as well as modelling. Accordingly, we present in this work the analysis of two CMEs that erupted from the Sun on 28 April 2012. We follow their eruption and early evolution using remote-sensing data, finding indications of CME--CME interaction, and then analyse their interplanetary counterpart(s) using in-situ measurements at Venus, Earth, and Saturn. We observe a seemingly single flux rope at all locations, but find possible signatures of interaction at Earth, where high-cadence plasma data are available. Reconstructions of the in-situ flux ropes provide almost identical results at Venus and Earth but show greater discrepancies at Saturn, suggesting that the CME was highly distorted and/or that further interaction with nearby solar wind structures took place before 10 AU. This work highlights the difficulties in connecting structures from the Sun to the outer heliosphere and demonstrates the importance of multi-spacecraft studies to achieve a deeper understanding of the magnetic configuration of CMEs.},

	abstract = {We propose a planet formation scenario to explain the elevated occurrence rates of transiting planets around M dwarfs compared to sun-like stars discovered by Kepler. We use a pebble drift and accretion model to simulate the growth of planet cores inside and outside of the snow line. A smaller pebble size interior to the snow line delays the growth of super-Earths, allowing giant planet cores in the outer disk to form first. When those giant planets reach pebble isolation mass they cut off the flow of pebbles to the inner disk and prevent the formation of close-in super-Earths. We apply this model to stars with masses between 0.1 and 2 solar mass and for a range of initial disk masses. We find that the masses of hot super-Earths and of cold giant planets are anti-correlated. The fraction of our simulations that form hot super-Earths is higher around lower-mass stars and matches the exoplanet occurrence rates from Kepler. The fraction of simulations forming cold giant planets is consistent with the stellar mass dependence from radial velocity surveys. A key testable prediction of the pebble accretion hypothesis is that the occurrence rates of super-Earths should decrease again for M dwarfs near the sub-stellar boundary like Trappist-1.},

Here we present 19 detections of coherent radio emission associated with known M{\textasciitilde}dwarfs from a blind flux-limited low-frequency survey. Our detections show that coherent radio emission is ubiquitous across the M{\textasciitilde}dwarf main sequence, and that the radio luminosity is independent of known coronal and chromospheric activity indicators. While plasma emission can generate the low-frequency emission from the most chromospherically active stars of our sample, the origin of the radio emission from the most quiescent sources is yet to be ascertained. Large-scale analogues of the magnetospheric processes seen in gas-giant planets likely drive the radio emission associated with these quiescent stars. The slowest-rotating stars of this sample are candidate systems to search for star-planet interaction signatures.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06368},
	abstract = {We aim at building a method that efficiently identifies young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs from low-resolution near-infrared spectra, by studying gravity-sensitive features and their evolution with age. We built a dataset composed of all publicly available (\${\textbackslash}sim\$2800) near-infrared spectra of dwarfs with spectral types between M0 and L3. First, we investigate methods for the derivation of the spectral type and extinction using comparison to spectral templates, and various spectral indices. Then, we examine gravity-sensitive spectral indices and apply machine learning methods, in order to efficiently separate young (\${\textbackslash}lesssim\$10 Myr) objects from the field. Using a set of six spectral indices for spectral typing, including two newly defined ones (TLI-J and TLI-K), we are able to achieve a precision below 1 spectral subtype across the entire spectral type range. We define a new gravity-sensitive spectral index (TLI-g) that consistently separates young from field objects, showing a performance superior to other indices from the literature. Even better separation between the two classes can be achieved through machine learning methods which use the entire NIR spectra as an input. Moreover, we show that the H- and K-bands alone are enough for this purpose. Finally, we evaluate the relative importance of different spectral regions for gravity classification as returned by the machine learning models. We find that the H-band broad-band shape is the most relevant feature, followed by the FeH absorption bands at 1.2 \${\textbackslash}mu m\$ and 1.24 \${\textbackslash}mu m\$ and the KI doublet at 1.24 \${\textbackslash}mu m\$.},

Over 6100 individual flare events, with energies ranging from 1029 to 1033 erg, are found in 11 months of 1 minute cadence data from Kepler. This sample is unique for its completeness and dynamic range. We have developed automated tools for finding flares in short-cadence Kepler light curves, and performed extensive validation and classification of the sample by eye. From this pristine sample of flares we generate a median flare template. This template shows that two exponential cooling phases are present during the white-light flare decay, providing fundamental constraints for models of flare physics. The template is also used as a basis function to decompose complex multi-peaked flares, allowing us to study the energy distribution of these events. Only a small number of flare events are not well fit by our template. We find that complex, multi-peaked flares occur in over 80\% of flares with a duration of 50 minutes or greater. The underlying distribution of flare durations for events 10 minutes and longer appears to follow a broken power law. Our results support the idea that sympathetic flaring may be responsible for some complex flare events.},

	abstract = {Here, we study the dichotomy of the escaping atmosphere of the newly discovered close-in exoplanet AU Microscopii (AU Mic) b. On one hand, the high extreme-ultraviolet stellar flux is expected to cause a strong atmospheric escape in AU Mic b. On the other hand, the wind of this young star is believed to be very strong, which could reduce or even inhibit the planet's atmospheric escape. AU Mic is thought to have a wind mass-loss rate that is up to 1000 times larger than the solar wind mass-loss rate ( \${\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ ). To investigate this dichotomy, we perform 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the stellar wind-planetary atmosphere interactions in the AU Mic system and predict the synthetic Ly α transits of AU Mic b. We systematically vary the stellar wind mass-loss rate from a 'no wind' scenario to up to a stellar wind with a mass-loss rate of \$1000{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$ . We find that, as the stellar wind becomes stronger, the planetary evaporation rate decreases from 6.5 × 1010 g s-1 to half this value. With a stronger stellar wind, the atmosphere is forced to occupy a smaller volume, affecting transit signatures. Our predicted Ly α absorption drops from \${\textbackslash}sim 20\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ in the case of 'no wind' to barely any Ly α absorption in the extreme stellar wind scenario. Future Ly α transits could therefore place constraints not only on the evaporation rate of AU Mic b, but also on the mass-loss rate of its host star.},

	doi = {10.1016/J.ICARUS.2005.05.021},
	abstract = {The Cassini spacecraft Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) obtained observations of Jupiter's auroral emissions in H-2 band systems and H Lyman-alpha from day 275 of 2000 (October 1), to day 81 of 2001 (March 22). Much of the globally integrated auroral variability measured with UVIS can be explained simply in terms of the rotation of Jupiter's main auroral arcs with the planet. These arcs were also imaged by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on Hubble Space Telescope (HST). However, several brightening events were seen by UVIS in which the global auroral output increased by a factor of 2-4. These events persisted over a number of hours and in one case can clearly be tied to a large solar coronal mass ejection event. The auroral UV emissions from these bursts also correspond to hectometric radio emission (0.5-16 MHz) increases reported by the Galileo Plasma Wave Spectrometer (PWS) and Cassim Radio and Plasma Wave Spectrometer (RPWS) experiments. In general, the hectometric radio data vary differently with longitude than the UV data because of radio wave beaming effects. The 2 largest events in the UVIS data were on 2000 day 280 (October 6) and on 2000 days 325-326 (November 20-21). The global brightening events on November 20-21 are compared with corresponding data on the interplanetary magnetic field, solar wind conditions, and energetic particle environment. ACE (Advanced Composition Explorer) solar wind data was numerically propagated from the Earth to Jupiter with an MHD code and compared to the observed event. A second class of brief auroral brightening events seen in HST (and probably UVIS) data that last for similar to 2 min is associated with aurora] flares inside the main auroral ovals. On January 8, 2001, from 18:45-19:35 UT UVIS H-2 band emissions from the north polar region varied quasiperiodically. The varying emissions, probably due to amoral flares inside the main auroral oval, are correlated with low-frequency quasiperiodic radio bursts in the 0.6-5 kHz Galileo PWS data.

	abstract = {Testing whether close-in massive exoplanets (hot Jupiters) can enhance the stellar activity in their host primary is crucial for the models of stellar and planetary evolution. Among systems with hot Jupiters, HD 189733 is one of the best studied because of its proximity, strong activity, and the presence of a transiting planet, which allows transmission spectroscopy and a measure of the planetary radius and its density. Here we report on the X-ray activity of the primary star, HD 189733 A, using a new XMM-Newton observation and a comparison with the previous X-ray observations. The spectrum in the quiescent intervals is described by two temperatures at 0.2 keV and 0.7 keV, while during the flares a third component at 0.9 keV is detected. With the analysis of the summed Reflection Grating Spectrometer spectra, we obtain estimates of the electron density in the range ne = (1.6-13) × 1010 cm-3, and thus the corona of HD 189733 A appears denser than the solar one. For the third time, we observe a large flare that occurred just after the eclipse of the planet. Together with the flares observed in 2009 and 2011, the events are restricted to a small planetary phase range of phi = 0.55-0.65. Although we do not find conclusive evidence of a significant excess of flares after the secondary transits, we suggest that the planet might trigger such flares when it passes close to the locally high magnetic field of the underlying star at particular combinations of stellar rotational phases and orbital planetary phases. For the most recent flares, a wavelet analysis of the light curve suggests a loop of length of four stellar radii at the location of the bright flare, and a local magnetic field of the order of 40-100 G, in agreement with the global field measured in other studies. The loop size suggests an interaction of magnetic nature between planet and star, separated by only {\textasciitilde}8R *. The X-ray variability of HD 189733 A is larger than the variability of field stars and young Pleiades of similar spectral type and X-ray luminosity. We also detect the stellar companion (HD 189733 B, {\textasciitilde}12'' from the primary star) in this XMM-Newton observation. Its very low X-ray luminosity (LX = 3.4 × 1026 erg s-1) confirms the old age of this star and of the binary system. The high activity of the primary star is best explained by a transfer of angular momentum from the planet to the star.},

These superflares have durations of hours to days and are visible from at least X-ray to optical frequencies. The absence of world-spanning aurorae in historical records and of anomalous extinctions in the geological record indicates that our Sun likely does not suffer superflares. In seeking to explain this new phenomenon, we are struck by its similarity to large stellar flares on RS Canum Venaticorum binary systems, which are caused by magnetic reconnection events associated with the tangling of magnetic fields between the two stars. The superflare stars are certainly not of this class, although we propose a similar flare mechanism. That is, superflares are caused by magnetic reconnection between fields of the primary star and a close-in Jovian planet. Thus, by invoking only known planetary properties and reconnection scenarios, we can explain the energies, durations, and spectra of superflares as well as explain why our Sun does not have such events.},

One of the strongest criticisms to this paradigm is the limited reproducibility of the process, especially at largely oversubscribed facilities. In this and in a subsequent paper, we address this specific aspect in a quantitative way, through a statistical study on proposal ranking at the European Southern Observatory. For this purpose, we analyzed a sample of about 15000 proposals, submitted by more than 3000 Principal Investigators over 8 years. The proposals were reviewed by more than 500 referees, who assigned over 140,000 grades in about 200 panel sessions. After providing a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the sample, the paper presents an heuristic model based on these findings, which is then used to provide quantitative estimates of the reproducibility of the pre-meeting process. On average, about one third of the proposals ranked in the top quartile by one referee are ranked in the same quartile by any other referee of the panel. A similar value is observed for the bottom quartile. In the central quartiles, the agreement fractions are very marginally above the value expected for a fully aleatory process (25\%). The agreement fraction between two panels composed by 6 referees is 55\% ± 5\% (50\% confidence level) for the top and bottom quartiles. The corresponding fraction for the central quartiles is 33\% ± 5\%. The model predictions are confirmed by the results obtained from bootstrapping the data for sub-panels composed by three referees, and fully consistent with the NIPS experiment. The post-meeting phase will be presented and discussed in a forthcoming paper.},

Important results have been obtained in the past few years on these radio emissions at the five magnetized planets, from the observations of Ulysses at Jupiter and of Wind and other Global Geospace Science spacecraft in Earth orbit, from the reanalysis of Voyager data about Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, from ground-based high frequency-time resolution and full polarization measurements, and from pioneering multispectral observations of the Jovian and Saturnian aurorae (radio/UV/IR). In parallel, considerable progress has been made in their generation theory (Cyclotron-Maser operating in small-scale, laminar, hot-plasma-dominated radio source structures), mostly on the basis of in situ observations of terrestrial radio sources. Particle acceleration and precipitation is also better documented, thanks to in situ measurements in the Earth auroral zones and to multispectral studies of Jupiter and Saturn. Finally, the modeling of the planetary magnetic field and magnetospheric plasma at these two planets has also been considerably improved. To organize the wealth of observational results within a coherent theoretical frame, we emphasize unresolved questions (e.g., planetary radio bursts generation) and contradictions and propose ways to answer them. Our ability, already significant, to perform remote sensing of magnetoplasmas at the giant planets and, hopefully, at other distant radio sources (solar, stellar) in the near future, depends on the good understanding of the physical processes underlying the generation of auroral electromagnetic emissions. The question of the existence of exoplanetary radio emissions and the possibility to detect and study them is briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Solar flares are often accompanied by filament/prominence eruptions ({\textasciitilde}104 K and {\textasciitilde}1010−11 cm−3), sometimes leading to coronal mass ejections that directly affect the Earth’s environment1,2. ‘Superflares’ are found on some active solar-type (G-type main-sequence) stars3–5, but the filament eruption–coronal mass ejection association has not been established. Here we show that our optical spectroscopic observation of the young solar-type star EK Draconis reveals evidence for a stellar filament eruption associated with a superflare. This superflare emitted a radiated energy of 2.0 × 1033 erg, and a blueshifted hydrogen absorption component with a high velocity of −510 km s−1 was observed shortly afterwards. The temporal changes in the spectra strongly resemble those of solar filament eruptions. Comparing this eruption with solar filament eruptions in terms of the length scale and velocity strongly suggests that a stellar coronal mass ejection occurred. The erupted filament mass of 1.1 × 1018 g is ten times larger than those of the largest solar coronal mass ejections. The massive filament eruption and an associated coronal mass ejection provide the opportunity to evaluate how they affect the environment of young exoplanets/the young Earth6 and stellar mass/angular momentum evolution7.},

	abstract = {Observations in the UV-regime are very important for exoplanet research, because many diagnostically important lines for studying stellar activity are in this regime. Studying stellar activity is not only important because of its negative effects on the determination planetary parameters, but also because the XUV-radiation from the host stars affects the photochemistry and the erosion of planetary atmospheres . Unfortunately, the XUV-region is only accessible from space. However, since the XUV-radiation is correlated with the CaII,HK-lines, we can use these lines to study the XUV radiation indirectly. The CaIIHK lines for relatively bright stars can be observed with PLATOspec, a new high-resolution echelle spectrograph in development for the ESO 1.5m telescope at La Silla. One advantage compared to instruments on larger telescopes will be that large programs can be carried out. There will be two modes for obtaining precise RV-measurements. In the future, the CUBES instrument on the VLT will be able to study the same lines to probe the XUV-radiation in much fainter targets.},

Both systems, TOI-558 (TIC 207110080) and TOI-559 (TIC 209459275), were identified from the 30-minute cadence Full Frame Images and confirmed using ground-based photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations from TESS's Follow-up Observing Program Working Group. We find that TOI-558 b, which transits an F-dwarf (\$M\_\{*\}=1.349{\textasciicircum}\{+0.064\}\_\{-0.065\}{\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, \$R\_\{*\}=1.496{\textasciicircum}\{+0.042\}\_\{-0.040\}{\textbackslash} R\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, \$T\_\{eff\}=6466{\textasciicircum}\{+95\}\_\{-93\}{\textbackslash} K\$, age \$1.79{\textasciicircum}\{+0.91\}\_\{-0.73\}{\textbackslash} Gyr\$) with an orbital period of 14.574 days, has a mass of \$3.61{\textbackslash}pm0.15{\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$, a radius of \$1.086{\textasciicircum}\{+0.041\}\_\{-0.038\}{\textbackslash} R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$, and an eccentric (e=\$0.300{\textasciicircum}\{+0.022\}\_\{-0.020\}\$) orbit. TOI-559 b transits a G-dwarf (\$M\_\{*\}=1.026{\textbackslash}pm0.057{\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, \$R\_\{*\}=1.233{\textasciicircum}\{+0.028\}\_\{-0.026\}{\textbackslash} R\_\{{\textbackslash}odot\}\$, \$T\_\{eff\}=5925{\textasciicircum}\{+85\}\_\{-76\}{\textbackslash} K\$, age \$6.8{\textasciicircum}\{+2.5\}\_\{-2.0\}{\textbackslash} Gyr\$) in an eccentric (e=\$0.151{\textbackslash}pm0.011\$) 6.984-day orbit with a mass of \$6.01{\textasciicircum}\{+0.24\}\_\{-0.23\}{\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$ and a radius of \$1.091{\textasciicircum}\{+0.028\}\_\{-0.025\}{\textbackslash} R\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$. Our spectroscopic follow-up also reveals a long-term radial velocity trend for TOI-559, indicating a long-period companion. The statistically significant orbital eccentricity measured for each system suggests that these planets migrated to their current location through dynamical interactions. Interestingly, both planets are also massive (\${\textgreater}3{\textbackslash} M\_\{{\textbackslash}rm J\}\$), adding to the population of massive giant planets identified by TESS. Prompted by these new detections of high-mass planets, we analyzed the known mass distribution of hot and warm Jupiters but find no significant evidence for multiple populations. TESS should provide a near magnitude-limited sample of transiting hot Jupiters, allowing for future detailed population studies.},

The large number of close-in exoplanets that have been discovered so far triggered a renewed interest in understanding magnetic interactions in other star-planet systems. Multiple magnetic effects were then unveiled, such as planet inflation or heating, planet migration, planetary material escape, and even some modifications of the host star apparent activity. Our goal here is to lay out the basic physical principles underlying star-planet magnetic interactions. We first briefly review the hot exoplanets' population as we know it. We then move to a general description of star-planet magnetic interactions, and finally focus on the fundamental concept of Alfvén wings and its implication for exosystems.},

	abstract = {As part of an All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) search for sources with large flux decrements, we discovered a transient where the quiescent, stellar source, ASASSN-V J192114.84+624950.8, rapidly decreased in flux by \${\textbackslash}sim55{\textbackslash}\%\$ (\${\textbackslash}sim0.9\$ mag) in the g-band. The {\textbackslash}textit\{TESS\} light curve revealed that the source is a highly eccentric, eclipsing binary. Fits to the light curve using {\textbackslash}textsc\{phoebe\} find the binary orbit to have \$e=0.79\$, \$P\_\{{\textbackslash}rm orb\}=18.462{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{days\}\$, and \$i=88.6{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\}\$ and the ratios of the stellar radii and temperatures to be \$R\_2/R\_1 = 0.71\$ and \$T\_\{e,2\}/T\_\{e,1\} = 0.82\$. Both stars are chromospherically active, allowing us to determine their rotational periods of \$P\_1=1.52\$ days and \$P\_2=1.79\$ days, respectively. A LBT/MODS spectrum shows that the primary is a late-G or early-K type dwarf. Fits to the SED show that the luminosities and temperatures of the two stars are \$L\_1 = 0.48{\textasciitilde}L\_\{{\textbackslash}sun\}\$, \$T\_1= 5050{\textasciitilde}K\$, \$L\_2 = 0.12{\textasciitilde}L\_\{{\textbackslash}sun\}\$, and \$T\_\{2\} = 4190{\textasciitilde}K\$.

	abstract = {Mass measurements and absorption line studies indicate that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is bottom-heavy in the central regions of many early-type galaxies, with an excess of low mass stars compared to the IMF of the Milky Way. Here we test this hypothesis using a method that is independent of previous techniques. Low mass stars have strong chromospheric activity characterized by non-thermal emission at short wavelengths. Approximately half of the UV flux of M dwarfs is contained in the \${\textbackslash}lambda\{\}1215.7\$ Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line, and we show that the total Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission of an early-type galaxy is a sensitive probe of the IMF with a factor of \${\textbackslash}sim 2\$ flux variation in response to plausible variations in the number of low mass stars. We use the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope to measure the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ line in the centers of the massive early-type galaxies NGC1407 and NGC2695. We detect Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ emission in both galaxies and demonstrate that it originates in stars. We find that the Ly\${\textbackslash}alpha\$ to i-band flux ratio is a factor of 2.0\${\textbackslash}pm\$0.4 higher in NGC1407 than in NGC2695, in agreement with the difference in their IMFs as previously determined from gravity-sensitive optical absorption lines. Although a larger sample of galaxies is required for definitive answers, these initial results support the hypothesis that the IMF is not universal but varies with environment.},

Simultaneously, we estimated the short-term variability of the surface through latitudinal differential rotation. Using the same data set, we also mapped the spatial distribution of prominences through tomography of Hα emission. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: As in our previous study, a large dark spot occupies the polar region of V530 Per with smaller, dark, and bright spots at lower latitudes. The large-scale magnetic field is dominated by a toroidal, mostly axisymmetric component. The maximal radial field strength is equal to {\textasciitilde}1 kG. The surface differential rotation is consistent with a smooth Sun-like shear dΩ = 0.053 ± 0.004 rad d{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, close to the solar shear level. The prominence pattern displays a stable component that is confined close to the corotation radius. We also observe rapidly evolving Hα emitting structures, over timescales ranging from minutes to days. The fast Hα evolution was not linked to any detected photospheric changes in the spot or magnetic coverage.},

Using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI), we obtained the first maps of photospheric brightness and large-scale magnetic field at the surface of this young star derived from NIR spectropolarimetric data. For the first time, ZDI is also simultaneously applied to high-resolution spectropolarimetric data and very-high-precision photometry. V410 Tau hosts both dark and bright surface features and magnetic regions similar to those previously imaged with ZDI from optical data, except for the absence of a prominent dark polar spot. The brightness distribution is significantly less contrasted than its optical equivalent, as expected from the difference in wavelength. The large-scale magnetic field (\$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}410\$ G), found to be mainly poloidal, features a dipole of \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}390\$ G, again compatible with previous studies at optical wavelengths. NIR data yield a surface differential rotation slightly weaker than that estimated in the optical at previous epochs. Finally, we measured the radial velocity of the star and filtered out the stellar activity jitter using both ZDI and Gaussian Process Regression down to a precision of \$\{{\textbackslash}sim\}0.15\$ and 0.08 \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{km\}{\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{s\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ RMS, respectively, confirming the previously published upper limit on the mass of a potential close-in massive planet around V410 Tau.},

	abstract = {The velocity-space distribution of the solar neighbourhood stars shows complex substructures. Most of the previous studies use static potentials to investigate their origins. Instead we use a self-consistent \$N\$-body model of the Milky Way, whose potential is asymmetric and evolves with time. In this paper, we quantitatively evaluate the similarities of the velocity-space distributions in the \$N\$-body model and that of the solar neighbourhood, using Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). The KLD analysis shows the time evolution and spatial variation of the velocity-space distribution. The KLD fluctuates with time, which indicates the velocity-space distribution at a fixed position is not always similar to that of the solar neighbourhood. Some positions show velocity-space distributions with small KLDs (high similarities) more frequently than others. One of them locates at \$(R,{\textbackslash}phi)=(8.2{\textbackslash};{\textbackslash}mathrm\{kpc\}, 30{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ\})\$, where \$R\$ and \${\textbackslash}phi\$ are the distance from the galactic centre and the angle with respect to the bar's major axis, respectively. The detection frequency is higher in the inter-arm regions than in the arm regions. In the velocity maps with small KLDs, we identify the velocity-space substructures, which consist of particles trapped in bar resonances. The bar resonances have significant impact on the stellar velocity-space distribution even though the galactic potential is not static.},

	abstract = {Photometric rotational modulations due to starspots remain the most common and accessible way to study stellar activity. In the Kepler-era, there now exists precise, continuous photometry of ∼150 000 stars presenting an unprecedented opportunity for statistical analyses of these modulations. Modelling rotational modulations allows one to invert the observations into several basic parameters, such as the rotation period, spot coverage, stellar inclination and differential rotation rate. The most widely used analytic model for this inversion comes from Budding and Dorren, who considered circular, grey starspots for a linearly limb darkened star. In this work, we extend the model to be more suitable in the analysis of high precision photometry, such as that by Kepler. Our new freely available FORTRAN code, macula, provides several improvements, such as non-linear limb darkening of the star and spot, a single-domain analytic function, partial derivatives for all input parameters, temporal partial derivatives, diluted light compensation, instrumental offset normalizations, differential rotation, starspot evolution and predictions of transit depth variations due to unocculted spots. Through numerical testing, we find that the inclusion of non-linear limb darkening means macula has a maximum photometric error an order-of-magnitude less than that of Dorren, for Sun-like stars observed in the Kepler-bandpass. The code executes three orders-of-magnitude faster than comparable numerical codes making it well suited for inference problems.},

	abstract = {One of the simplest ways to identify an exoplanetary transit is to phase fold a photometric time series upon a trial period - leading to a coherent stack when using the correct value. Such phase-folded transits have become a standard data visualization in modern transit discovery papers. There is no analogous folding mechanism for exomoons, which would have to represent some kind of double fold: once for the planet and then another for the moon. Folding with the planet term only, a moon imparts a small decrease in the surrounding out-of-transit averaged intensity, but its incoherent nature makes it far less convincing than the crisp stacks familiar to exoplanet hunters. Here, a new approach is introduced that can be used to achieve the transit origami needed to double fold an exomoon, in the case where a planet exhibits transit timing variations (TTVs). This double fold has just one unknown parameter, the satellite-to-planet mass ratio, and thus a simple one-dimensional grid search can be used to rapidly identify power associated with candidate exomoons. The technique is demonstrated on simulated light curves, exploring the breakdown limits of close-in and/or inclined satellites. As an example, the method is deployed on Kepler-973b, a warm mini-Neptune exhibiting an 8-min TTV, where the possibility that the TTVs are caused by a single exomoon is broadly excluded, with upper limits probing down to a Ganymede-sized moon.},

Accordingly, we here look ahead and aim to provide a statistical framework for interpreting such events and providing guidance to future observations, under the basic premise that the phenomenon in question stochastically repeat at some unknown, constant rate, λ. Specifically, expressions are derived for (1) the a posteriori distribution for λ, (2) the a posteriori distribution for the recurrence time, and, (3) the benefit-to-cost ratio of further observations relative to that of the inaugural event. Some rule-of-thumb results for each of these are found to be (1) \${\textbackslash}lambda {\textbackslash}lbrace 0.7, 2.3, 4.6{\textbackslash}rbrace {\textbackslash}, t\_1{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ to \${\textbackslash}lbrace 50, 90, 95{\textbackslash}rbrace \{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ confidence (where t1 = time to obtain the first detection), (2) the recurrence time is \$t\_2 {\textbackslash}lbrace 1, 9, 99{\textbackslash}rbrace {\textbackslash}, t\_1\$ to \${\textbackslash}lbrace 50, 90, 95{\textbackslash}rbrace \{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ confidence, with a lack of repetition by time t2 yielding a p-value of 1/[1 + (t2/t1)], and, (3) follow-up for \${\textbackslash}lesssim 10{\textbackslash}, t\_1\$ is expected to be scientifically worthwhile under an array of differing assumptions about the object's intrinsic scientific value. We apply these methods to the Breakthrough Listen Candidate 1 signal and tidal disruption events observed by TESS.},

We found that after correcting some errors we were able to describe relationships among active region size, peak flare soft X-ray (SXR) flux (measured by GOES 1-8 Å flux), and magnetic classification. We found the Solar Optical Observing Network magnetic classification to be reasonably accurate but its area measures to be inaccurate for many of the regions. This is due partly to transcription errors and partly to wrong correction for limb foreshortening. Errors could, however, be repaired by intercomparison of multiple observations. We confirm Künzel's original idea that regions classified βγδ produce many more large flares than other regions of comparable size. Almost all substantial flares occurred in regions classified βγδ by the Air Force sites. Each region larger than 1000 μh and classified βγδ had nearly 40\% probability of producing flares classified X1 or greater. Yet only a half-dozen of those, showing the ``island delta'' configuration, produced great activity. There is a general trend for large regions to produce large flares, but it is less significant than the dependence on magnetic class.},

Since these stars are too faint for conventional Doppler imaging, which makes use of only one or a few lines, we take the large number of photospheric metal lines available in an echelle spectrum, and deconvolve them into a single, high signal-to-noise ratio profile. We show that this technique results in a typical multiplex gain of 22.5 in signal-to-noise ratio for a given spectrum, the equivalent of using a single line obtained on a 63-m telescope. The image reconstructions demonstrate that both these stars have cool high-latitude regions or polar crowns, and low-latitude features, in contradiction to the suggestion that only high-latitude spots should be present.Cross-correlation between image reconstructions of He 699, 31 days apart, reveals a lack of correlation between detailed small-scale structures. This places an upper limit for the lifetime of the observed features at less than one month. The Hα profiles are also found to exhibit absorption features indicating the presence of prominence clouds, at or below the corotation radius.},

The 0.38-d axial rotation period and the V-band magnitude of 9.33 make it a difficult target for Doppler imaging. In order to obtain high signal-to-noise ratio profiles from 300-s exposures, we apply the technique of least-squares deconvolution to the large number of photospheric absorption lines available in each of our spectra. This allows us to derive high-resolution maximum-entropy-regularized Doppler images of the stellar surface. Using these techniques, we also derive radial velocities and accurate projected equatorial rotation velocities which are consistent to within ∼1 km s−1.Our surface maps reveal one of the most heavily spotted photospheres seen on a rapid rotator, with starspots occurring at all latitudes. At the time of observations, Speedy Mic had no strong polar spot, but it shows spots concentrated in low- and intermediate-latitude bands. We attempt a differential rotation measurement, but lack of sufficient phase coverage allows determination of only a lower limit of 59 d for the time it takes the equatorial regions to lap the polar regions.We also find variations in the heavily filled-in Hα line which can be attributed to prominences passing in front of the stellar disc. Despite the rapid rotation, the appearance of the same features on consecutive nights of observations shows the clouds to be stable on time-scales of at least a day.},

Of the 19 stars for which we do not recover a P rot, 17 were not observed by K2. As K2's three Praesepe campaigns took place over the course of 3 yr, we test the stability of our measured P rot for stars observed in more than one campaign. We measure P rot consistent to within 10\% for {\textgreater}95\% of the 331 likely single stars with ≥2 high-quality observations; the median difference in P rot is 0.3\%, with a standard deviation of 2\%. Nearly all of the exceptions are stars with discrepant P rot measurements in Campaign 18, K2's last, which was significantly shorter than the earlier two (≍50 days rather than ≍75 days). This suggests that, despite the evident morphological evolution we observe in the light curves of 38\% of the stars, P rot measurements for low-mass stars in Praesepe are stable on timescales of several years.

We found that the fraction of stars with superflares among the stars showing large-amplitude rotational variations, which are thought to be the signature of the large starspots, also decreases as the rotation period increases. The small fraction of superflare stars among the stars with large starspots in the longer-period regime suggests that some of the stars with large starspots show a much lower flare activity than the superflare stars with the same spot area. Assuming simple relations between spot area and lifetime and between spot temperature and photospheric temperature, we compared the size distribution of large starspot groups on slowly rotating solar-type stars with that of sunspot groups. The size distribution of starspots shows the power-law distribution and the size distribution of larger sunspots lies on this power-law line. We also found that frequency-energy distributions for flares originating from spots with different sizes are the same for solar-type stars with superflares and the Sun. These results suggest that the magnetic activity we observe on solar-type stars with superflares and on the Sun is caused by the same physical processes.},

The origin of flux tubes of a sufficient strength (∼105 G) is, however, uncertain. This paper considers the instability of a large-scale toroidal magnetic field caused by the magnetic suppression of convective heat transport as a candidate for the flux-tube formation mechanism. The consideration employs the analytical dependence of eddy diffusion on the magnetic field supplied by mean-field magnetohydrodynamics. The instability tends to produce regions of increased field strength with spatial scales of the order of 100 Mm at the base of the convection zone. Characteristic growth times of the instability are short compared to the 11 yr cycle. The threshold field strength for the onset of the instability increases from several hundred Gauss in the vicinity of the equator to some kilo-Gauss at middle latitudes. Growth rates of unstable disturbances decrease with latitude. These latitudinal trends can be the reason for the observed confinement of sunspot activity to a near-equatorial belt.},

	abstract = {Many fully convective stars exhibit a wide variety of surface magnetism, including starspots and chromospheric activity. The manner by which bundles of magnetic field traverse portions of the convection zone to emerge at the stellar surface is not especially well understood. In the solar context, some insight into this process has been gleaned by regarding the magnetism as consisting partly of idealized thin flux tubes (TFTs). Here we present the results of a large set of TFT simulations in a rotating spherical domain of convective flows representative of a 0.3 M ⊙ main-sequence star. This is the first study to investigate how individual flux tubes in such a star might rise under the combined influence of buoyancy, convection, and differential rotation. A time-dependent hydrodynamic convective flow field, taken from separate 3D simulations calculated with the anelastic equations, impacts the flux tube as it rises. Convective motions modulate the shape of the initially buoyant flux ring, promoting localized rising loops. Flux tubes in fully convective stars have a tendency to rise nearly parallel to the rotation axis. However, the presence of strong differential rotation allows some initially low-latitude flux tubes of moderate strength to develop rising loops that emerge in the near-equatorial region. Magnetic pumping suppresses the global rise of the flux tube most efficiently in the deeper interior and at lower latitudes. The results of these simulations aim to provide a link between dynamo-generated magnetic fields, fluid motions, and observations of starspots for fully convective stars.},

However, in the B1.8 flare on 2016 December 2, the Si iv line profiles are wholly redshifted throughout the flare evolution. We fit the wholly redshifted line profiles with a single-Gaussian function, but fit the red-asymmetric ones with a double-Gaussian function to deduce the corresponding Doppler velocities. In addition, we find that hard X-ray emission above 25 keV shows up in the two large flares, implying a nonthermal electron beam heating. In the microflare, there only appears weak hard X-ray emission up to 12 keV, indicative of a mostly thermal heating. We interpret the redshifts or red asymmetries of the Si iv line at the ribbons in the three flares as spectral manifestations of chromospheric condensation. We propose that whether the line appears to be wholly redshifted or red-asymmetric depends on the heating mechanisms, as well as on the propagation of the condensation.},

	abstract = {Surges often appear as a result of the emergence of magnetized plasma from the solar interior. Traditionally, they are observed in chromospheric lines such as Hα 6563 and Ca ii 8542 . However, whether there is a response to the surge appearance and evolution in the Si iv lines or, in fact, in many other transition region lines has not been studied. In this paper, we analyze a simultaneous episode of an Hα surge and a Si iv burst that occurred on 2016 September 03 in active region AR 12585. To that end, we use coordinated observations from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. For the first time, we report emission of Si iv within the surge, finding profiles that are brighter and broader than the average. Furthermore, the brightest Si iv patches within the domain of the surge are located mainly near its footpoints. To understand the relation between the surges and the emission in transition region lines like Si iv, we have carried out 2.5D radiative MHD (RMHD) experiments of magnetic flux emergence episodes using the Bifrost code and including the nonequilibrium ionization of silicon. Through spectral synthesis, we explain several features of the observations. We show that the presence of Si iv emission patches within the surge, their location near the surge footpoints and various observed spectral features are a natural consequence of the emergence of magnetized plasma from the interior to the atmosphere and the ensuing reconnection processes.},

	abstract = {The helium absorption triplet at a wavelength of 10833 Å has been proposed as a way to probe the escaping atmospheres of exoplanets. Recently this feature was detected for the first time using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-107b. We use similar HST/WFC3 observations to detect helium in the atmosphere of the hot Neptune HAT-P-11b at the 4σ confidence level. We compare our observations to a grid of 1D models of hydrodynamic escape to constrain the thermospheric temperatures and mass loss rate. We find that our data are best fit by models with high mass loss rates of {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}≈ \{10\}9\{--\}\{10\}11 g s-1. Although we do not detect the planetary wind directly, our data are consistent with the prediction that HAT-P-11b is experiencing hydrodynamic atmospheric escape. Nevertheless, the mass loss rate is low enough that the planet has only lost up to a few percent of its mass over its history, leaving its bulk composition largely unaffected. This matches the expectation from population statistics, which indicate that close-in planets with radii greater than 2 R ⊕ form and retain H/He-dominated atmospheres. We also confirm the independent detection of helium in HAT-P-11b obtained with the CARMENES instrument, making this the first exoplanet with the detection of the same signature of photoevaporation from both ground- and space-based facilities.},

During the {\textasciitilde}25 days of TESS observations, we acquired three simultaneous UV/X-ray observations using Swift that total {\textasciitilde}18 ks, 21 simultaneous epochs totaling {\textasciitilde}98 ks of X-ray data using NICER, one observation ({\textasciitilde}3 hr) with UH88, and one observation ({\textasciitilde}3 hr) with LCOGT. We identified 56 flares in the TESS light curve with estimated energies in the range log ET (erg) = (30.5-33.2), nine flares in the Swift UVM2 light curve with estimated energies in the range log EUV (erg) = (29.3-31.1), 14 flares in the NICER light curve with estimated minimum energies in the range log EN (erg) = (30.5-32.3), and 1 flare in the LCOGT light curve with log EL (erg) = 31.6. We find that the flare frequency distributions (FFDs) of TESS and NICER flares have comparable slopes, βT = -0.67 ± 0.09 and βN = - 0.65 ± 0.19, and the FFD of UVOT flares has a shallower slope (βU = -0.38 ± 0.13). Furthermore, we do not find conclusive evidence for either the first ionization potential (FIP) or the inverse FIP effect during coronal flares on EV Lac.},

Planets at such small orbital distances can result in significant interactions with their host stars, which can induce increased activity levels in them. In this work, we have searched for statistical evidence for star-planet interactions in the ultraviolet (UV) using the largest sample of 1355 Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) detected host stars with confirmed exoplanets and making use of the improved host-star parameters from Gaia DR2. From our analysis, we do not find any significant correlation between the UV activity of the host stars and their planetary properties. We further compared the UV properties of planet host stars to that of chromospherically active stars from the RAdial Velocity Experiment (RAVE) survey. Our results indicate that the enhancement in chromospheric activity of host stars due to star-planet interactions may not be significant enough to reflect in their near- and far-UV broadband flux.},

	abstract = {Observational evidence of star-planet magnetic interactions (SPMIs) in compact exosystems have been looked for in the past decades. Indeed, planets in close-in orbit can be magnetically connected to their host star and can channel Alfvén waves carrying large amounts of energy toward the central star. The strength and temporal modulation of SPMIs are primarily set by the magnetic topology of the host star and the orbital characteristics of the planet. As a result, SPMI signals can be modulated over the rotational period of the star, the orbital period of the planet, or a complex combination of the two. The detection of SPMIs thus has to rely on multiple-epoch and multiple-wavelength observational campaigns. We present a new method to characterize SPMIs and apply it to Kepler-78, a late G star with a super-Earth on an 8.5 hr orbit. We model the corona of Kepler-78 using the large-scale magnetic topology of the star observed with Zeeman-Doppler imaging. We show that the closeness of Kepler-78b allows the interaction with channel energy flux densities up to a few kW m-2 toward the central star. We show that this flux is large enough to be detectable in classical activity tracers such as Hα. It is nonetheless too weak to explain the modulation observed by Moutou et al. We furthermore demonstrate how to predict the temporal modulation of SPMI signals in observed systems such as Kepler-78. The methodology presented here thus paves the way toward denser, more specific observational campaigns that would allow proper identification of SPMIs in compact star-planet systems.},

	abstract = {Low-frequency (ν ≲ 150 MHz) stellar radio emission is expected to originate in the outer corona at heights comparable to and larger than the stellar radius. Such emission from the Sun has been used to study coronal structure, mass ejections and space-weather conditions around the planets1. Searches for low-frequency emission from other stars have detected only a single active flare star2 that is not representative of the wider stellar population. Here we report the detection of low-frequency radio emission from a quiescent star, GJ 1151—a member of the most common stellar type (red dwarf or spectral class M) in the Galaxy. The characteristics of the emission are similar to those of planetary auroral emissions3 (for example, Jupiter’s decametric emission), suggesting a coronal structure dominated by a global magnetosphere with low plasma density. Our results show that large-scale currents that power radio aurorae operate over a vast range of mass and atmospheric composition, ranging from terrestrial planets to main-sequence stars. The Poynting flux required to produce the observed radio emission cannot be generated by GJ 1151’s slow rotation, but can originate in a sub-Alfvénic interaction of its magnetospheric plasma with a short-period exoplanet. The emission properties are consistent with theoretical expectations4–7 for interaction with an Earth-size planet in an approximately one- to five-day-long orbit.},

They also afford the most accessible near future opportunity to study the atmospheres of terrestrial planets. Because they are intrinsically low in luminosity, the identification of the nearest examples of these M dwarfs is essential for progress. We present the volume-complete, all-sky list of 512 M dwarfs with masses 0.1 ≤ M/M⊙ ≤ 0.3 and with trigonometric distances placing them within 15 pc (πtrig ≥ 66.67 mas) from which we have created a sample of 413 M dwarfs for spectroscopic study. We present the mass function for these 512 M dwarfs, which increases with decreasing stellar mass in linear mass space, but is flat in logarithmic mass space. As part of this sample, we present new VJRKCIKC photometry for 17 targets, measured as a result of the RECONS group's long-term work at the CTIO/SMARTS 0.9 m telescope. We also note the details of targets that are known to be members of multiple systems and find a preliminary multiplicity rate of 21\% ± 2\% for the primary M dwarfs in our sample when considering known stellar and brown dwarf companions at all separations from their primaries. We further find that 43 ± 2\% of all M dwarfs with masses 0.1 ≤ M/M⊙ ≤ 0.3 are found in multiple systems with primary stars of all masses within 15 pc.},

In the millimeter and FUV, this flare is the brightest ever detected, brightening by a factor of {\textgreater}1000 and {\textgreater}14,000 as seen by ALMA and HST, respectively. The millimeter and FUV continuum emission trace each other closely during the flare, suggesting that millimeter emission could serve as a proxy for FUV emission from stellar flares and become a powerful new tool to constrain the high-energy radiation environment of exoplanets. Surprisingly, optical emission associated with the event peaks at a much lower level with a time delay. The initial burst has an extremely short duration, lasting for {\textless}10 s. Taken together with the growing sample of millimeter M dwarf flares, this event suggests that millimeter emission is actually common during stellar flares and often originates from short burst-like events.},

	abstract = {The discovery of a population of close-orbiting giant planets (\${\textbackslash}le\$ 1 au) has raised a number of questions about their origins and dynamical histories. These issues have still not yet been fully resolved, despite over 20 years of exoplanet detections and a large number of discovered exoplanets. In particular, it is unclear whether warm Jupiters (WJs) form in situ, or whether they migrate from further outside and are even currently migrating to form hot Jupiters (HJs). Here, we report the possible discovery and characterization of the planets in a highly mutually-inclined (\$I\_\{{\textbackslash}rm mut\}{\textbackslash}simeq 45{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$), compact two-planet system (KOI-984), in which the newly discovered warm Jupiter KOI-984\$c\$ is on a 21.5-day, moderately eccentric (\$e{\textbackslash}simeq 0.4\$) orbit, in addition to a previously known 4.3-day planet candidate KOI-984\$b\$. Meanwhile, the orbital configuration of a moderately inclined (\$I\_\{{\textbackslash}rm mut\}{\textbackslash}simeq 15{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ\$), low-mass (\$m\_\{c\}{\textbackslash}simeq 24 M\_\{{\textbackslash}oplus\}\$;\$P\_b{\textbackslash}simeq 8.6\$ days) perturbing planet near 1:2 mean motion resonace with KOI-984\$b\$ could also well reproduce observed transit timing variations and transit duration variations of KOI-984\$b\$. Such an eccentric WJ with a close-in sibling would pose a challenge to the proposed formation and migration mechanisms of WJs, if the first scenario is supported with more evidences in near future; this system with several other well-measured inclined WJ systems (e.g., Kepler-419 and Kepler-108) may provide additional clues for the origin and dynamical histories of WJs.},

	abstract = {Context. Young (≲600 Myr) low-mass stars (M ≲ 1 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) of equal mass exhibit a distribution of rotation periods. At the very early phases of stellar evolution, this distribution is set by the star-disc locking mechanism, which forces stars to rotate at the same rate as the inner edge of the disc. The primordial disc lifetime and consequently the duration of the disc-locking mechanism, can be significantly shortened by the presence of a close companion, making the rotation period distribution of close binaries different from that of either single stars or wide binaries. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: We use new data to investigate and better constrain the range of ages, the components separation, and the mass ratio dependence at which the rotation period distribution has been significantly affected by the disc dispersal that is enhanced by close companions. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We select a sample of close binaries in the Upper Scorpius association (age ∼8 Myr) whose components have measured the separation and the rotation periods and compare their period distribution with that of coeval stars that are single stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: We find that components of close binaries have, on average, rotation periods that are shorter than those of single stars. More precisely, binaries with approximately equal-mass components (0.9 ≤ M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} ≤ 1.0) have rotation periods that are shorter than those of single stars by ∼0.4 d on average; the primary and secondary components of binaries with smaller mass ratios (0.8 \&lt; M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}1{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 0.9) have rotation periods that are shorter than those of single stars by ∼1.9 d and ∼1.0 d on average, respectively. A comparison with the older 25 Myr β Pictoris association shows that whereas in the latter, all close binaries with projected separation ρ ≤ 80 AU rotate faster than single stars, in the Upper Scorpius this is only the case for about 70\% of stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: We interpret the enhanced rotation in close binaries with respect to single stars as the consequence of an early disc dispersal induced by the presence of close companions.

The gradual periodic fluctuation is interpreted as the rotational modulation of magnetic features on the stellar surface and is used to deduce magnetic feature activity properties. The flare spikes in light curves are used to derive flare activity properties. In this paper, we analyze the light curve data of three solar-type stars (KIC 6034120, KIC 3118883, and KIC 10528093) observed with Kepler space telescope and investigate the relationship between their magnetic feature activities and flare activities. The analysis shows that: (1) both the magnetic feature activity and the flare activity exhibit long-term variations as the Sun does; (2) unlike the Sun, the long-term variations of magnetic feature activity and flare activity are not in phase with each other; (3) the analysis of star KIC 6034120 suggests that the long-term variations of magnetic feature activity and flare activity have a similar cycle length. Our analysis and results indicate that the magnetic features that dominate rotational modulation and the flares possibly have different source regions, although they may be influenced by the magnetic field generated through a same dynamo process.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of flare activity in wide binary stars using a combination of value-added data sets from the NASA Kepler mission. The target list contains a set of previously discovered wide binary star systems identified by proper motions in the Kepler field. We cross-matched these systems with estimates of flare activity for ∼200,000 stars in the Kepler field, allowing us to compare relative flare luminosity between stars in coeval binaries. From a sample of 184 previously known wide binaries in the Kepler field, we find 58 with detectable flare activity in at least 1 component, 33 of which are similar in mass (q {\textgreater} 0.8). Of these 33 equal-mass binaries, the majority display similar (±1 dex) flare luminosity between both stars, as expected for stars of equal mass and age. However, we find two equal-mass pairs where the secondary (lower mass) star is more active than its counterpart, and two equal-mass pairs where the primary star is more active. The stellar rotation periods are also anomalously fast for stars with elevated flare activity. Pairs with discrepant rotation and activity qualitatively seem to have lower mass ratios. These outliers may be due to tidal spin-up, indicating these wide binaries could be hierarchical triple systems. We additionally present high-resolution adaptive optics images for two wide binary systems to test this hypothesis. The demographics of stellar rotation and magnetic activity between stars in wide binaries may be useful indicators for discerning the formation scenarios of these systems.},

	abstract = {Using a recent census of flare stars from the Kepler survey, we have explored how flare activity evolves across stellar main-sequence lifetimes. We utilize a sample of 347 stars with robust flare activity detections and which have rotation periods measured via starspot modulations in their Kepler light curves. We consider three separate methods for quantifying flare activity from optical light curves and compare their utility for comparing flare activity between stars of differing ages and luminosities. These metrics include the fractional luminosity emitted in flares, the specific rate of flares emitted at a given energy, and a model for the entire flare frequency distribution (FFD). With all three approaches, we find that flare activity decreases for all low-mass stars as they spin down, and thus with age. Most striking is the evolution of the flare occurrence frequency distributions, which show no significant change in the power-law slope with age. Since our sample is preferentially constructed of younger, more active stars, our model overpredicts the superflare rate previously estimated for the Sun. Finally, we parameterize our best-fit model of the FFD for ease in predicting the rates of flares and their associated impacts on planet habitability and detection.},

Flares may erode exoplanets' atmospheres and impact their habitability, but might also trigger the genesis of life around small stars. TESS provides a new sample of bright dwarf stars in our galactic neighborhood, collecting data for thousands of M dwarfs that might host habitable exoplanets. Here, we use an automated search for flares accompanied by visual inspection. Then, our public allesfitter code robustly selects the appropriate model for potentially complex flares via Bayesian evidence. We identify 1228 flaring stars, 673 of which are M dwarfs. Among 8695 flares in total, the largest superflare increased the stellar brightness by a factor of 16.1. Bolometric flare energies range from 1031.0 to 1036.9 erg, with a median of 1033.1 erg. Furthermore, we study the flare rate and energy as a function of stellar type and rotation period. We solidify past findings that fast rotating M dwarfs are the most likely to flare and that their flare amplitude is independent of the rotation period. Finally, we link our results to criteria for prebiotic chemistry, atmospheric loss through coronal mass ejections, and ozone sterilization. Four of our flaring M dwarfs host exoplanet candidates alerted on by TESS, for which we discuss how these effects can impact life. With upcoming TESS data releases, our flare analysis can be expanded to almost all bright small stars, aiding in defining criteria for exoplanet habitability.},

We find that below a critical value of Hα EW = -0.71 Å, log R31.5 increases linearly with increasing Hα emission; above this value, log R31.5 declines rapidly. The stars divide into two groups: 26\% have Hα in emission, high flare rates with typical values of log R31.5 = -1.30 ± 0.08, and have Rossby numbers {\textless}0.50.

The Evryscope array of telescopes has observed all bright nearby stars in the south, producing 2-minute cadence light curves since 2016. Long-term, high-cadence observations of rotating flare stars probe the complex relationship between stellar rotation, starspots, and superflares. We detect periods from 0.3487 to 104 days and observe amplitudes from 0.008 to 0.216 g' mag. We find that the Evryscope amplitudes are larger than those in TESS with the effect correlated to stellar mass (p-value = 0.01). We compute the Rossby number (Ro) and find that our sample selected for flaring has twice as many intermediate rotators (0.04 {\textless} Ro {\textless} 0.4) as fast (Ro {\textless} 0.04) or slow (Ro {\textgreater} 0.44) rotators; this may be astrophysical or a result of period detection sensitivity. We discover 30 fast, 59 intermediate, and 33 slow rotators. We measure a median starspot coverage of 13\% of the stellar hemisphere and constrain the minimum magnetic field strength consistent with our flare energies and spot coverage to be 500 G, with later-type stars exhibiting lower values than earlier-type stars. We observe a possible change in superflare rates at intermediate periods. However, we do not conclusively confirm the increased activity of intermediate rotators seen in previous studies. We split all rotators at Ro ∼ 0.2 into bins of PRot {\textless} 10 days and PRot {\textgreater} 10 days to confirm that short-period rotators exhibit higher superflare rates, larger flare energies, and higher starspot coverage than do long-period rotators, at p-values of 3.2 × 10-5, 1.0 × 10-5, and 0.01, respectively.},

	abstract = {It is well established that solar energetic particles (SEPs) are accelerated in at least two separate ways; in flaring regions and at energetic shocks in the corona and interplanetary medium. It is often assumed that this leads to two well separated classes of SEP events, so--called `impulsive' and `gradual', and that flares make no contribution in the larger, gradual, events. This paper examines the characteristics of the flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with a group of particle events not biased by any abundance variation; they were selected on the basis of having highly anisotropic beams of {\textgreater}100 keV electrons at their onset. There are events belonging to both classes in this sample. It is shown that there is a smooth transition in the characteristics of the associated phenomena. Since almost all events have associated flares and CMEs and flare particles escape in impulsive events then it is highly likely that they do in gradual events as well. It is hoped that this paper will stimulate discussions about the differences between gradual and impulsive flares.},

Each LSTM model is used to make predictions of its corresponding ϒ-class flares. The essence of our approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use LSTMs to capture temporal information of the data samples. Each data sample has 40 features including 25 magnetic parameters obtained from the Space-weather HMI Active Region Patches and related data products as well as 15 flare history parameters. We survey the flare events that occurred from 2010 May to 2018 May, using the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite X-ray flare catalogs provided by the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), and select flares with identified ARs in the NCEI flare catalogs. These flare events are used to build the labels (positive versus negative) of the data samples. Experimental results show that (i) using only 14–22 most important features including both flare history and magnetic parameters can achieve better performance than using all 40 features together; (ii) our LSTM network outperforms related machine-learning methods in predicting the labels of the data samples.

We use point estimates of the binary fraction (binary fractions over specific separation and companion mass ratio ranges) from four M dwarf surveys sampling distinct orbital radii to fit a log-normal function to the orbital separation distribution. This model, alongside the companion mass ratio distribution given by Reggiani \& Meyer (2013), is used to calculate the frequency of companions over the ranges of mass ratio (q) and orbital separation (a) over which the referenced surveys were collectively sensitive - [0.60 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ q \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 1.00] and [0.00 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ a \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 10,000 AU]. This method was then extrapolated to calculate a binary fraction which encompasses the broader ranges of [0.10 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ q \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 1.00] and [0.00 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ a {\textless} \${\textbackslash}infty\$ AU]. Finally, the results of these calculations were compared to the binary fractions of other spectral types. The binary fraction over the constrained regions of [0.60 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ q \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 1.00] and [0.00 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ a \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 10,000 AU] was calculated to be \$0.229 {\textbackslash}pm 0.028\$. This quantity was then extrapolated over the broader ranges of q (0.10 - 1.00) and a (0.00 - \${\textbackslash}infty\$ AU) and found to be \$0.462{\textasciicircum}\{+0.057\}\_\{-0.052\}\$. We used a conversion factor to estimate the multiplicity fraction from the binary fraction and found the multiplicity fraction over the narrow region of [0.60 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ q \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 1.00] and [0.00 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ a \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 10,000 AU] to be \$0.270 {\textbackslash}pm 0.111\$. Lastly, we estimate the multiplicity fractions of FGK, and A stars using the same method (taken over [0.60 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ q \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 1.00] and [0.00 \${\textbackslash}leq\$ a \${\textbackslash}leq\$ 10,000 AU]) and find that the multiplicity fractions of M, FGK, and A stars, when considered over common ranges of q and a, are more similar than generally assumed.},

However, although many numerical simulations have been conducted to reproduce the solar differential rotation2-7, previous high-resolution calculations with solar parameters fall into the antisolar (fast-pole) differential rotation regime. Consequently, we still do not know the true reason why the Sun has a fast-rotating equator. While the construction of the fast equator requires a strong rotational influence on the convection, the previous calculations have not been able to achieve the situation without any manipulations. The problem is called the convective conundrum8. The convection and the differential rotation in numerical simulations were different from the observations. Here, we show that a high-resolution calculation succeeds in reproducing the solar-like differential rotation. Our calculations indicate that the strong magnetic field generated by a small-scale dynamo has a significant impact on thermal convection. The successful reproduction of the differential rotation, convection and magnetic field achieved in our calculation is an essential step to understanding the cause of the most basic nature of solar activity, specifically, the 11 yr cycle of sunspot activity.},

	abstract = {Solar flares significantly impact the conditions of the Earth's ionosphere. In particular, the sudden increase in X-ray flux during a flare penetrates down to the lowest-lying D-region and dominates ionization at these altitudes (≈60 - 100 km). Measurements of very low frequency (VLF: 3 - 30 kHz) radio waves that reflect at D-region altitudes provide a unique remote-sensing probe to investigate the D-region response to solar-flare emissions. Here, using a combination of VLF amplitude measurements at 24 kHz together with X-ray observations from the Geostationary Operational Environment Satellite (GOES) X-ray sensor, we present a large-scale statistical study of 334 solar-flare events and their impacts on the D-region over the past solar cycle. Focusing on both GOES broadband X-ray channels, we investigate how the flare peak fluxes and position on the solar disk dictate an ionospheric response and extend this to investigate the characteristic time delay between incident X-ray flux and the D-region response. We show that the VLF amplitude linearly correlates with both the 1 - 8 Å and 0.5 - 4 Å channels, with correlation coefficients of 0.80 and 0.79, respectively. For the two X-class flares in our sample, however, there appears to be a turnover in the linear relationship, similar to previous works. Unlike higher altitude ionospheric regions for which the location of the flare on the solar disk affects the ionospheric response, we find that the D-region response to solar flares does not depend on the flare location. By comparing the time delays between the peak X-ray fluxes in both GOES channels and VLF amplitudes, we find that there is an important difference between the D-region response and the X-ray spectral band. We also demonstrate for several flare events that show a negative time delay, the peak VLF amplitude matches with the impulsive 25 - 50 keV hard X-ray fluxes measured by the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). These results highlight the importance of performing full spectral analysis when studying the ionospheric responses to solar flares.},

	abstract = {Many young- and intermediate-age massive stellar clusters host bimodal distributions in the rotation rates of their stellar populations, with a dominant peak of rapidly rotating stars and a secondary peak of slow rotators. The origin of this bimodal rotational distribution is currently debated and two main theories have been put forward in the literature. The first is that all/most stars are born as rapid rotators and that interacting binaries break a fraction of the stars, resulting in two populations. The second is that the rotational distribution is a reflection of the early evolution of pre-main sequence stars, in particular, whether they are able to retain or lose their protoplanetary discs during the first few Myr. Here, we test the binary channel by exploiting multi-epoch Very Large Telescope/MUSE observations of NGC 1850, an {\textasciitilde}100 Myr massive cluster in the Large Magellanic Cloud, to search for differences in the binary fractions of the slow- and fast-rotating populations. If binarity is the cause of the rotational bimodality, we would expect that the slowly rotating population should have a much larger binary fraction than the rapid rotators. However, in our data we detect similar fractions of binary stars in the slow and rapidly rotating populations (5.9 ± 1.1 and 4.5 ± 0.6 per cent, respectively). Hence, we conclude that binarity is not a dominant mechanism in the formation of the observed bimodal rotational distributions.},

	abstract = {I really liked Mauricio's recent post, Many Undergrads Should Take Light
Courseloads. I agree that the majority of the value of college is outside of the
classes, and that taking too many classes can detract from other very important
things you could be doing.

Still, as a student, you do have to take classes in order to graduate. Most of
those classes will be determined by your major and what you intend to do after
college. But, at least in the US, some of your classes won't be related to your
major. What should you take?

As a computer science major, I have taken some non-CS classes that were far more
valuable than the average CS class. Most of them were history classes. In
general, I think that history classes can be quite useful, especially for people
in EA. In this post, I'll share some lessons I've learned from history.

First, a couple caveats:

 * I'm generally interested in history so this is likely to be biased. This
   might not be the advice for you if you've always hated history classes (but
   again, maybe you just haven't had the right history class).
 * Yale (the university I attend) is supposed to have one of the best history
   departments in the world (according to dubious news sources). It's possible
   this isn't good advice at some universities with weaker history departments,
   but I doubt this.

With those out of the way, I'll share what I've learned from history classes:

 * Well-meaning people can do very bad things. History is filled with people who
   we would now call immoral, because of the terrible actions that they took.
   While some of them acted purely out of self-interest, others were actually
   trying to do good.
 * The ends often don't pan out. Consequentialism is obviously quite important
   in EA, for very good reason. That being said, history is filled with examples
   of consequentialism going wrong. Why? Because somebody was overconfident in
   their predictions about the value or probability of the ends. They put very},

However, these methods largely ignore the number of flares the active region has already produced, in particular the number of small events. The past history of occurrence of flares (of all sizes) is an important indicator of future flare production. We present a Bayesian approach to flare prediction, which uses the flaring record of an active region together with phenomenological rules of flare statistics to refine an initial prediction for the occurrence of a big flare during a subsequent period of time. The initial prediction is assumed to come from one of the extant methods of flare prediction. The theory of the method is outlined, and simulations are presented to show how the refinement step of the method works in practice.},

	abstract = {The use of Gaussian processes (GPs) as models for astronomical time series data sets has recently become almost ubiquitous, given their ease of use and flexibility. In particular, GPs excel at marginalization over the stellar signal when the variability due to starspots is treated as a nuisance, as in exoplanet transit modeling. However, these effective models are less useful in cases where the starspot signal is of primary interest, since it is not obvious how the parameters of the GP relate to physical parameters like the spot size, contrast, and latitudinal distribution. Instead, it is common practice to explicitly model the effect of individual starspots on the light curve and attempt to infer their properties via optimization or posterior inference. Unfortunately, this process is ill-posed and often computationally intractable when applied to stars with more than a few spots and/or to ensembles of many stars. Here we derive a closed-form expression for a GP that describes the light curve of a rotating, evolving stellar surface conditioned on a given distribution of starspot sizes, contrasts, and latitudes. We demonstrate that this model is correctly calibrated, allowing one to robustly infer physical parameters of interest from one or more light curves, including the typical spot radii and latitudes. Our GP has far-ranging implications for understanding the variability and magnetic activity of stars from light curves and radial velocity measurements, as well as for modeling correlated noise in exoplanet searches. Our implementation is efficient, user-friendly, and open-source, available in the package starry\_process.},

(1987), the idea has been applied to solar physics, in "Avalanches and the Distribution of Solar Flares" by Lu and Hamilton (1991). In the following years, an inspiring cross-fertilization from complexity theory to solar and astrophysics took place, where the SOC concept was initially applied to solar flares, stellar flares, and magnetospheric substorms, and later extended to the radiation belt, the heliosphere, lunar craters, the asteroid belt, the Saturn ring, pulsar glitches, soft X-ray repeaters, blazars, black-hole objects, cosmic rays, and boson clouds. The application of SOC concepts has been performed by numerical cellular automaton simulations, by analytical calculations of statistical (powerlaw-like) distributions based on physical scaling laws, and by observational tests of theoretically predicted size distributions and waiting time distributions. Attempts have been undertaken to import physical models into the numerical SOC toy models, such as the discretization of magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) processes. The novel applications stimulated also vigorous debates about the discrimination between SOC models, SOC-like, and non-SOC processes, such as phase transitions, turbulence, random-walk diffusion, percolation, branching processes, network theory, chaos theory, fractality, multi-scale, and other complexity phenomena. We review SOC studies from the last 25 years and highlight new trends, open questions, and future challenges, as discussed during two recent ISSI workshops on this theme.},

We have identified 373 flaring stars, some of which flare multiple times during the observation period. We calculate relative flare energies, flare rates, and durations and compare these with the quiescent photometric variability of our sample. We find that M dwarfs tend to flare more frequently but for shorter durations than K dwarfs and that they emit more energy relative to their quiescent luminosity in a given flare than K dwarfs. Stars that are more photometrically variable in quiescence tend to emit relatively more energy during flares, but variability is only weakly correlated with flare frequency. We estimate distances for our sample of flare stars and find that the flaring fraction agrees well with other observations of flare statistics for stars within 300 pc above the Galactic plane. These observations provide a more rounded view of stellar flares by sampling stars that have not been pre-selected by their activity, and are informative for understanding the influence of these flares on planetary habitability.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines the current understanding of solar flares, mainly focused on magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes responsible for producing a flare. Observations show that flares are one of the most explosive phenomena in the atmosphere of the Sun, releasing a huge amount of energy up to about 1032 erg on the timescale of hours. Flares involve the heating of plasma, mass ejection, and particle acceleration that generates high-energy particles. The key physical processes for producing a flare are: the emergence of magnetic field from the solar interior to the solar atmosphere (flux emergence), local enhancement of electric current in the corona (formation of a current sheet), and rapid dissipation of electric current (magnetic reconnection) that causes shock heating, mass ejection, and particle acceleration. The evolution toward the onset of a flare is rather quasi-static when free energy is accumulated in the form of coronal electric current (field-aligned current, more precisely), while the dissipation of coronal current proceeds rapidly, producing various dynamic events that affect lower atmospheres such as the chromosphere and photosphere. Flares manifest such rapid dissipation of coronal current, and their theoretical modeling has been developed in accordance with observations, in which numerical simulations proved to be a strong tool reproducing the time-dependent, nonlinear evolution of a flare. We review the models proposed to explain the physical mechanism of flares, giving an comprehensive explanation of the key processes mentioned above. We start with basic properties of flares, then go into the details of energy build-up, release and transport in flares where magnetic reconnection works as the central engine to produce a flare.},

Different degrees of departure from a Poisson process have been found, depending on the flare intensities and levels of star activities. We then fit the waiting time distributions with both the non-stationary Poisson function and the Weibull function. It is evident that a certain amount of memory is present during the period of high solar activities, consistent with the result of Telloni et al.

Identifying the underlying causes is challenging, and thus, solving the problem remains difficult. To better understand the reasons for the leaky pipeline, we assess the perceptions and impacts of gender bias and imbalance—two major drivers of the leakage—at different academic career levels with an anonymous survey in geoscience academia (n=1,220). The survey results show that both genders view male geoscientists as substantially more gender biased than female scientists. Moreover, female geoscientists are more than twice as likely to experience negative gender bias at their workplaces and scientific organizations compared to male geoscientists. There are also pronounced gender differences regarding (i) the relevance of role models, (ii) family-friendly working conditions, and (iii) the approval of gender quotas for academic positions. Given the male dominance in senior career levels, our results emphasize that those feeling less impacted by the negative consequences of gender bias and imbalance are the ones in position to tackle the problem. We thus call for actions to better address gender biases and to ensure a balanced gender representation at decision-making levels to ultimately retain more women in geoscience academia.},

An alternative approach is to study the temporal behaviour of X-rays emitted by bright extragalactic X-ray sources, where an orbiting planet would temporarily block the X-rays and cause a brief eclipse. We report on such a potential event in the X-ray binary M51-ULS-1 in the galaxy M51. We examined a range of explanations for the observed X-ray dip, including a variety of transiting objects and enhancements in the density of gas and dust. The latter are ruled out by the absence of changes in X-ray colours, save any with sharp density gradients that cannot be probed with our data. Instead, the data are well fit by a planet transit model in which the eclipser is most likely to be the size of Saturn. We also find that the locations of possible orbits are consistent with the survival of a planet bound to a mass-transfer binary.},

	abstract = {By extending our previous study by Maehara et al., we searched for superflares on G-type dwarfs (solar-type stars) using Kepler data for a longer period (500 days) than that (120 days) in our previous study. As a result, we found 1547 superflares on 279 G-type dwarfs, which is much more than the previous 365 superflares on 148 stars. Using these new data, we studied the statistical properties of the occurrence rate of superflares, and confirmed the previous results, i.e., the occurrence rate (dN/dE) of superflares versus flare energy (E) shows a power-law distribution with dN/dEvpropE -α, where α {\textasciitilde} 2. It is interesting that this distribution is roughly similar to that for solar flares. In the case of the Sun-like stars (with surface temperature 5600-6000 K and slowly rotating with a period longer than 10 days), the occurrence rate of superflares with an energy of 1034-1035 erg is once in 800-5000 yr. We also studied long-term (500 days) stellar brightness variation of these superflare stars and found that in some G-type dwarfs the occurrence rate of superflares was extremely high, {\textasciitilde}57 superflares in 500 days (i.e., once in 10 days). In the case of Sun-like stars, the most active stars show a frequency of one superflare (with 1034 erg) in 100 days. There is evidence that these superflare stars have extremely large starspots with a size about 10 times larger than that of the largest sunspot. We argue that the physical origin of the extremely high occurrence rate of superflares in these stars may be attributed to the existence of extremely large starspots.},

Main-sequence late-type stars with masses of less than 0.35 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} are fully convective. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Aims: The goal is to study convection, differential rotation, and dynamos as functions of rotation in fully convective stars. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: Three-dimensional hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations with a star-in-a-box model, in which a spherical star is immersed inside of a Cartesian cube, are used. The model corresponds to a 0.2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} main-sequence M5 dwarf. A range of rotation periods (P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) between 4.3 and 430 d is explored. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Results: The slowly rotating model with P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 430 days produces anti-solar differential rotation with a slow equator and fast poles, along with predominantly axisymmetric quasi-steady large-scale magnetic fields. For intermediate rotation (P{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}rot{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 144 and 43 days) the differential rotation is solar-like (fast equator, slow poles), and the large-scale magnetic fields are mostly axisymmetric and either quasi-stationary or cyclic. The latter occurs in a similar parameter regime as in other numerical studies in spherical shells, and the cycle period is similar to observed cycles in fully convective stars with rotation periods of roughly 100 days. In the rapid rotation regime the differential rotation is weak and the large-scale magnetic fields are increasingly non-axisymmetric with a dominating m = 1 mode. This large-scale non-axisymmetric field also exhibits azimuthal dynamo waves. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Conclusions: The results of the star-in-a-box models agree with simulations of partially convective late-type stars in spherical shells in that the transitions in differential rotation and dynamo regimes occur at similar rotational regimes in terms of the Coriolis (inverse Rossby) number. This similarity between partially and fully convective stars suggests that the processes generating differential rotation and large-scale magnetism are insensitive to the geometry of the star.},

	abstract = {The pandemic has become predictable, which is the world we much prefer to live
in. Cases and deaths continue their slow but steady declines, vaccine approvals
for boosters and children continue to slowly move forward. Mandates continue to
make people angry but mostly work when used, while also not that often being
used. Same old, same old.

The big news story was that one of the studies of Long Covid was revealed to be
vastly overestimating frequency due to a methodological ‘error.’ It’s an
important update.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 1. Cases and deaths declining as expected.
 2. Approvals progressing slowly as expected.
 3. Long Covid study had important error, see discussion later in post.

Let’s run the numbers.

THE NUMBERS
PREDICTIONS
Prediction from last week: 560k cases (-10\%) and 11,500 deaths (-8\%).

Results: 547k cases (-12\%) and 11,051 deaths (-12\%).

Prediction for next week: 481k cases (-12\%) and 9,835 deaths (-11\%).

We are still in a low-variance situation, with no reason to expect any big
surprises for at least several more weeks.

DEATHS
The exact rate of decline here was a pleasant surprise, but we’ve gotten to the
point where this is a lagging indicator, so the times when it is surprising are
mostly about data gathering issues, either holidays or changes in the ways in
which we do testing. Expect this trend to continue, and continue to mirror cases
with a lag.

CASES
This is pretty much exactly what we would have expected. The Northeast number is
slightly disappointing, others were slightly better than expected, but no real
surprises.

VACCINATIONS
The rate of vaccinations continues to not change much, and it’s clear that the
positive bump wasn’t the start of a surge. That continues not to tell us much
about how much work the mandates are doing here. My impression is that the
mandates that have teeth work, but that few of them have teeth.

	abstract = {I appreciate Zoe Curzi's revelations of her experience with Leverage. I know how
hard it is to speak up when no or few others do, and when people are trying to
keep things under wraps.

I haven't posted much publicly about my experiences working as a researcher at
MIRI (2015-2017) or around CFAR events, to a large degree because I've been
afraid. Now that Zoe has posted about her experience, I find it easier to do so,
especially after the post was generally well-received by LessWrong.

I felt moved to write this, not just because of Zoe's post, but also because of 
Aella's commentary:

I've found established rationalist communities to have excellent norms that
prevent stuff like what happened at Leverage. The times where it gets weird is
typically when you mix in a strong leader + splintered, isolated subgroup + new
norms. (this is not the first time)

This seemed to me to be definitely false, upon reading it. Most of what was
considered bad about the events at Leverage Research also happened around
MIRI/CFAR, around the same time period (2017-2019).

I don't want to concentrate on the question of which is "worse"; it is hard to
even start thinking about that without discussing facts on the ground and
general social models that would apply to both cases. I also caution against
blame in general, in situations like these, where many people (including me!)
contributed to the problem, and have kept quiet for various reasons. With good
reason, it is standard for truth and reconciliation events to focus on
restorative rather than retributive justice, and include the possibility of
forgiveness for past crimes.

As a roadmap for the rest of the post, I'll start by describing some background,
describe some trauma symptoms and mental health issues I and others have
experienced, and describe the actual situations that these mental events were
influenced by and "about" to a significant extent.

However, due to strong pressures, stellar winds can confine planetary atmospheres, reducing their escape. Here, we investigate under which conditions atmospheric escape of close-in giants could be confined by the large pressure of their host star’s winds. For that, we simulate escape in planets at a range of orbital distances ([0.04, 0.14] au), planetary gravities ([36, 87 per cent] of Jupiter’s gravity), and ages ([1, 6.9] Gyr). For each of these simulations, we calculate the ram pressure of these escaping atmospheres and compare them to the expected stellar wind external pressure to determine whether a given atmosphere is confined or not. We show that although younger close-in giants should experience higher levels of atmospheric escape, due to higher stellar irradiation, stellar winds are also stronger at young ages, potentially reducing escape of young exoplanets. Regardless of the age, we also find that there is always a region in our parameter space where atmospheric escape is confined, preferably occurring at higher planetary gravities and orbital distances. We investigate confinement of some known exoplanets and find that the atmosphere of several of them, including π Men c, should be confined by the winds of their host stars, thus potentially preventing escape in highly irradiated planets. Thus, the lack of hydrogen escape recently reported for π Men c could be caused by the stellar wind.},

Magnetic star-planet interactions involve the release of energy stored in the stellar and planetary magnetic fields. These signals thus offer indirect detections of exoplanetary magnetic fields. Here, we report the derivation of the magnetic field strengths of four hot Jupiter systems, using the power observed in calcium uc(ii) K emission modulated by magnetic star-planet interactions. By approximating the fractional energy released in the calcium uc(ii) K line, we find that the surface magnetic field values for the hot Jupiters in our sample range from 20 G to 120 G, around 10-100 times larger than the values predicted by dynamo scaling laws for planets with rotation periods of around 2-4 days. However, these values are in agreement with scaling laws relating the magnetic field strength to the internal heat flux in giant planets. Large planetary magnetic field strengths may produce observable electron cyclotron maser radio emission by preventing the maser from being quenched by the planet's ionosphere. Intensive radio monitoring of hot Jupiter systems will help to confirm these field values and inform the generation mechanism of magnetic fields in this important class of exoplanets.},

In this study we monitored the chromospheric activity using several stellar activity indicators of seven stars with hot Jupiters using new high-resolution echelle spectra collected with ESPaDOnS over a few nights in 2005 and 2006 from the CFHT (Ca II H λ3968, K λ3933, the Ca II infrared triplet [IRT] λ8662 line, Hα λ6563, and He I λ5876). Synchronicity of the Ca II H and K emission of HD 179949 with its planet's orbit is clearly seen in four out of six epochs, while rotational modulation with Prot = 7 days is apparent in the other two seasons. We observe a similar phenomenon on υ And. This on/off nature of star-planet interaction (SPI) in the two systems is likely a function of the changing stellar magnetic field structure throughout its activity cycle. Variability in the transiting system HD 189733 is likely associated with an active region rotating with the star; however, the flaring in excess of the rotational modulation may be associated with its hot Jupiter. As for HD 179949, the peak variability as measured by the mean absolute deviation (MAD) for both HD 189733 and τ Boo leads the subplanetary longitude by {\textasciitilde}70°. The tentative correlation between this activity and the ratio of Mpsin i to the planet's rotation period, a quantity proportional to the hot Jupiter's magnetic moment, first presented by Shkolnik and coworkers remains viable.

The same is expected to occur when observing the stellar radio flux. However, at radio wavelengths, the planet also radiates, depending on its temperature, and thus modifies the transit depths. We explore this scenario simulating the radio lightcurves of transits of hot Jupiters, Kepler-17b, and WASP-12b, around solar-like stars. We calculated the bremsstrahlung radio emission at 17, 100, and 400 GHz originating from the star, considering a solar atmospheric model. The planetary radio emission was calculated modeling the planets in two scenarios: as a blackbody or with a dense and hot extended atmosphere. In both cases the planet radiates and contributes to the total radio flux. For a blackbody planet, the transit depth is in the order of 2\%–4\% and it is independent of the radio frequency. Hot Jupiters planets with atmospheres appear bigger and brighter in radio, thus having a larger contribution to the total flux of the system. Therefore, the transit depths are larger than in the case of blackbody planets, reaching up to 8\% at 17 GHz. Also the transit depth is frequency-dependent. Moreover, the transit caused by the planet passing behind the star is deeper than when the planet transits in front of the star, being as large as 18\% at 400 GHz. In all cases, the contribution of the planetary radio emission to the observed flux is evident when the planet transits behind the star.},

We use the energy flux scaling law presented by Christensen et al. to calculate the evolution of average magnetic fields in extrasolar planets and brown dwarfs under the assumption of fast rotation, which is probably the case for most of them. We find that massive brown dwarfs of about 70 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} can have fields of a few kilo-Gauss during the first few hundred Million years. These fields can grow by a factor of two before they weaken after deuterium burning has stopped. Brown dwarfs with weak deuterium burning and extrasolar giant planets start with magnetic fields between {\textasciitilde}100 G and {\textasciitilde}1 kG at the age of a few Myr, depending on their mass. Their magnetic field weakens steadily until after 10 Gyr it has shrunk by about a factor of 10. We use observed X-ray luminosities to estimate the age of the known extrasolar giant planets that are more massive than 0.3 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}Jup{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and closer than 20 pc. Taking into account the age estimate, and assuming sun-like wind-properties and radio emission processes similar to those at Jupiter, we calculate their radio flux and its frequency. The highest radio flux we predict comes out as 700 mJy at a frequency around 150 MHz for τ Boo b, but the flux is below 60 mJy for the rest. Most planets are expected to emit radiation between a few Mhz and up to 100 MHz, well above the ionospheric cutoff frequency.},

Our radial velocity (RV) time-series exhibits activity-induced fluctuations of 45 m s-1 rms, ∼3 times smaller than those measured in the optical domain, that we filter using Gaussian Process Regression. We report a 3.9σ detection of the recently discovered 8.46 -d transiting planet AU Mic b, with an estimated mass of 17.1 \${\textasciicircum}\{+4.7\}\_\{-4.5\}\$ M⊕ and a bulk density of 1.3 ± 0.4 g cm-3, inducing an RV signature of semi-amplitude K = 8.5 \${\textasciicircum}\{+2.3\}\_\{-2.2\}\$ m s-1 in the spectrum of its host star. A consistent detection is independently obtained when we simultaneously image stellar surface inhomogeneities and estimate the planet parameters with Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI). Using ZDI, we invert the time-series of unpolarized and circularly polarized spectra into surface brightness and large-scale magnetic maps. We find a mainly poloidal and axisymmetric field of 475 G, featuring, in particular, a dipole of 450 G tilted at 19° to the rotation axis. Moreover, we detect a strong differential rotation of dΩ = 0.167 ± 0.009 rad d-1 shearing the large-scale field, about twice stronger than that shearing the brightness distribution, suggesting that both observables probe different layers of the convective zone. Even though we caution that more RV measurements are needed to accurately pin down the planet mass, AU Mic b already appears as a prime target for constraining planet formation models, studying the interactions with the surrounding debris disc, and characterizing its atmosphere with upcoming space- and ground-based missions.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the atmospheres of planets orbiting M dwarfs requires understanding the spectral energy distributions of M dwarfs over planetary lifetimes. Surveys like MUSCLES, HAZMAT, and FUMES have collected multiwavelength spectra across the spectral type's range of Teff and activity, but the extreme ultraviolet (EUV, 100-912 Å) flux of most of these stars remains unobserved because of obscuration by the interstellar medium compounded with limited detector sensitivity. While targets with observable EUV flux exist, there is no currently operational facility observing between 150 and 912 Å. Inferring the spectra of exoplanet hosts in this regime is critical to studying the evolution of planetary atmospheres because the EUV heats the top of the thermosphere and drives atmospheric escape. This paper presents our implementation of the differential emission measure technique to reconstruct the EUV spectra of cool dwarfs. We characterize our method's accuracy and precision by applying it to the Sun and AU Mic. We then apply it to three fainter M dwarfs: GJ 832, Barnard's star, and TRAPPIST-1. We demonstrate that with the strongest far-ultraviolet (FUV, 912-1700 Å) emission lines, observed with the Hubble Space Telescope and/or Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer, and a coarse X-ray spectrum from either the Chandra X-ray Observatory or XMM-Newton, we can reconstruct the Sun's EUV spectrum to within a factor of 1.8, with our model's formal uncertainties encompassing the data. We report the integrated EUV flux of our M dwarf sample with uncertainties of a factor of 2-7 depending on available data quality.},

Here we present a detailed analysis of the magnetic field of AU Mic based on previously unpublished high-resolution optical and near-infrared spectropolarimetric observations. We report a systematic detection of circular and linear polarization signatures in the stellar photospheric lines. Tentative Zeeman Doppler imaging modeling of the former data suggests a nonaxisymmetric global field with a surface-averaged strength of about 90 G. At the same time, linear polarization observations indicate the presence of a much stronger ≍2 kG axisymmetric dipolar field, which contributes no circular polarization signal due to the equator-on orientation of AU Mic. A separate Zeeman broadening and intensification analysis allowed us to determine a mean field modulus of 2.3 and 2.1 kG from the Y- and K-band atomic lines, respectively. These magnetic field measurements are essential for understanding environmental conditions within the AU Mic planetary system.},

	abstract = {M stars are ideal targets to search for Earth-like planets. However, they usually have high levels of magnetic activity, which could affect their habitability and make difficult the detection of exoplanets orbiting around them. Unfortunately, long-term variability of dM stars has not been extensively studied, due to their low intrinsic brightness. For this reason, in 1999 we started the HKα project, which systematically observes the spectra of a large number of stars, in particular dM stars, at the Complejo Astronómico El Leoncito (CASLEO). In this work, we study the long-term activity of the young active dM1 star AU Microscopii. We analyse the Mount Wilson index S derived from CASLEO spectra obtained between 2004 and 2016, which we complement with the S-index derived from HARPS, FEROS, and UVES public spectra. We also analyse the simultaneous photometric counterpart provided by the ASAS public data base for this star between 2000 and 2009, and our own photometry. In both totally independent time series, we detect a possible activity cycle of period ∼5 yr. We also derived a precise rotation period for this star Prot = 4.85 d, consistent with the literature. This activity cycle reflects that an αΩ dynamo could be operating in this star.},

Vigorous convection within their metallic cores may produce dynamos and thus magnetospheres if the total heat flow out of the core exceeds a critical value. Earth has a core-hosted dynamo because plate tectonics cools the core relatively rapidly. In contrast, Venus has no dynamo and its deep interior probably cools slowly. Here, we develop scaling laws for how planetary mass affects the minimum heat flow required to sustain both thermal and chemical convection, which we compare to a simple model for the actual heat flow conveyed by solid-state mantle convection. We found that the required heat flows increase with planetary mass (to a power of ∼0.8-0.9), but the actual heat flow may increase even faster (to a power of ∼1.6). Massive super-Earths are likely to host a dynamo in their metallic cores if their silicate mantles are entirely solid. Super-Venuses with relatively slow mantle convection could host a dynamo if their mass exceeds ∼1.5 (with an inner core) or ∼4 (without an inner core) Earth-masses. However, the mantles of massive rocky exoplanets might not be completely solid. Basal magma oceans may reduce the heat flow across the core-mantle boundary and smother any core-hosted dynamo. Detecting a magnetosphere at an Earth-mass planet probably signals Earth-like geodynamics. In contrast, magnetic fields may not reliably reveal if a massive exoplanet is a super-Earth or a super-Venus. We eagerly await direct observations in the next few decades.},

Here, we report our analysis of its TESS light curve, where we modeled the BY Draconis type quasi-periodic rotational modulation by starspots simultaneously to the flaring activity and planetary transits. We measured a flare occurrence rate in AU Mic of 6.35 flares per day for flares with amplitudes in the range of 0.06\% \&lt; f{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}max{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 1.5\% of the star flux. We employed a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis to model the five transits of AU Mic b observed by TESS, improving the constraints on the planetary parameters. The measured planet-to-star effective radius ratio of R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}p{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}∕R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⋆{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} = 0.0496 ± 0.0007 implies a physical radius of 4.07 ± 0.17 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and a planet density of 1.4 ± 0.4 g cm{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}−3{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}, confirming that AU Mic b is a Neptune-size moderately inflated planet. While a single feature possibly due to a second planet was previously reported in the former TESS data, we report the detection of two additional transit-like events in the new TESS observations of July 2020. This represents substantial evidence for a second planet (AU Mic c) in the system. We analyzed its three available transits and obtained an orbital period of 18.859019 ± 0.000016 d and a planetary radius of 3.24 ± 0.16 R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, which defines AU Mic c as a warm Neptune-size planet with an expected mass in the range of 2.2 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}c{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} \&lt; 25.0 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, estimated from the population of exoplanets of similar sizes. The two planets in the AU Mic system are in near 9:4 mean-motion resonance. We show that this configuration is dynamically stable and should produce transit-timing variations (TTV). Our non-detection of significant TTV in AU Mic b suggests an upper limit for the mass of AU Mic c of \&lt;7 M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊕{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, indicating that this planet is also likely to be inflated. As a young multi-planet system with at least two transiting planets, AU Mic becomes a key system for the study of atmospheres of infant planets and of planet-planet and planet-disk dynamics at the early stages of planetary evolution.},

	abstract = {Exoplanets sufficiently close to their host star can in principle couple electrodynamically to the star. This process is known as electrodynamic star-planet interaction (SPI). The expected emission associated with this coupling, however, is difficult to observe due to the bright intrinsic stellar emission. Identification of time variability in the stellar light curve is one of the most promising approaches to identify SPI. In this work we therefore systematically investigate various mechanisms and their associated periods, which generate time variability to aid the search for SPI. We find that the synodic rotation period of the stars and half of this period, as measured in the rest frames of the orbiting exoplanets, are basic periods occurring in SPI. We apply our findings to the example of TRAPPIST-1 with its seven close-in planets, for which we investigate the possibility of SPI and the associated time variabilities. We show that TRAPPIST-1b and c, in particular, are very likely subject to sub-Alfvénic interaction, a necessary condition for SPI. Both planets are therefore expected to generate Alfvén wings, which can couple to the star. The associated Poynting fluxes are of the order of 1011 to 1015 W and thus can hardly be the direct source of currently observable time variability from TRAPPIST-1. However, these Poynting fluxes might trigger flares on the star. We find correlations between the observed flares and the expected planet-induced signals, which could be due to SPI, but our findings are not conclusive and warrant further observations and modeling.},

We build this emission line sample from a combination of new and archival observations with the Hubble Space Telescope-COS and -STIS instruments, targeting the chromospheric and transition region emission lines of Si III, N V, C II, and Si IV. We find that the exoplanet host stars, on average, display factors of 5-10 lower UV activity levels compared with the non-planet-hosting sample; this is explained by a combination of observational and astrophysical biases in the selection of stars for radial-velocity planet searches. We demonstrate that UV activity-rotation relation in the full F - M star sample is characterized by a power-law decline (with index α ≈ -1.1), starting at rotation periods ≳3.5 days. Using N V or Si IV spectra and knowledge of the star’s bolometric flux, we present a new analytic relationship to estimate the intrinsic stellar EUV irradiance in the 90-360 Å band with an accuracy of roughly a factor of ≈2. Finally, we study the correlation between SPI strength and UV activity in the context of a principal component analysis that controls for the sample biases. We find that SPIs are not a statistically significant contributor to the observed UV activity levels.

Detailed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stellar wind simulations have demonstrated that surface magnetic field morphology has a strong influence on wind-driven angular momentum loss. Observations suggest that faster rotating stars store a larger fraction of their magnetic flux in higher-order multipolar components of the magnetic field. In this work, we present an entirely predictive new model for stellar spin-down that accounts for the stellar surface magnetic field configuration. We show how a magnetic complexity that evolves from complex toward simple configurations as a star spins down can explain the salient features of stellar rotation evolution, including the bimodal distribution of both slow and fast rotators seen in young OCs.

Motivated by these exciting new results, in this paper we present Alfvén wave-driven stellar wind models of the two active planet-hosting M dwarfs Prox Cen and AU Mic. Our models incorporate large-scale photospheric magnetic field maps reconstructed using the Zeeman-Doppler imaging method. We obtain a mass-loss rate of \$0.25{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ for the wind of Prox Cen. For the young dwarf AU Mic, we explore two cases: a low and a high mass-loss rate. Depending on the properties of the Alfvén waves that heat the corona in our wind models, we obtain mass-loss rates of 27 and \$590{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$ for AU Mic. We use our stellar wind models to assess the generation of electron cyclotron maser instability emission in both systems, through a mechanism analogous to the sub-Alfvénic Jupiter-Io interaction. For Prox Cen, we do not find any feasible scenario where the planet can induce radio emission in the star's corona, as the planet orbits too far from the star in the super-Alfvénic regime. However, in the case that AU Mic has a stellar wind mass-loss rate of \$27{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}dot\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{ M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot \}\$, we find that both planets b and c in the system can induce radio emission from {\textasciitilde}10 MHz to 3 GHz in the corona of the host star for the majority of their orbits, with peak flux densities of {\textasciitilde}10 mJy. Detection of such radio emission would allow us to place an upper limit on the mass-loss rate of the star.},

Radial velocity confirmation of such a planet has proven inconclusive, and it remains possible that the radio emission could be generated by a stellar coronal process. Using data from TESS, we shed light on this question by probing the stellar activity and flares of GJ 1151 as well as fourteen other M dwarfs detected by LOFAR. GJ 1151 and three other star-planet interaction candidates are found to be inactive, with no rotational modulation and few, if any, flares. The remainder of the LOFAR detected M dwarfs flare frequently. We consider it unlikely that stellar activity is responsible for the bright, circularly-polarized emission from GJ 1151 and its three analogs, and support the star-planet magnetic interaction interpretation.},

Where once we knew of just one planetary system (the solar system), we now know of thousands, with new systems being announced on a weekly basis. Of the thousands of planetary systems we have found to date, however, there is only one that we can study up-close and personal—the solar system. In this review, we describe our current understanding of the solar system for the exoplanetary science community—with a focus on the processes thought to have shaped the system we see today. In section one, we introduce the solar system as a single well studied example of the many planetary systems now observed. In section two, we describe the solar system's small body populations as we know them today—from the two hundred and five known planetary satellites to the various populations of small bodies that serve as a reminder of the system's formation and early evolution. In section three, we consider our current knowledge of the solar system's planets, as physical bodies. In section four we discuss the research that has been carried out into the solar system's formation and evolution, with a focus on the information gleaned as a result of detailed studies of the system's small body populations. In section five, we discuss our current knowledge of planetary systems beyond our own—both in terms of the planets they host, and in terms of the debris that we observe orbiting their host stars. As we learn ever more about the diversity and ubiquity of other planetary systems, our solar system will remain the key touchstone that facilitates our understanding and modeling of those newly found systems, and we finish section five with a discussion of the future surveys that will further expand that knowledge.},

	abstract = {The past several years have seen dramatic developments in the study of planetary magnetic fields, including a wealth of new data, mainly from the Galilean satellites and Mars, together with major improvements in our theoretical modeling effort of the dynamo process believed responsible for large planetary fields. These dynamos arise from thermal or compositional convection in fluid regions of large radial extent. The relevant electrical conductivities range from metallic values to values that may be only about 1\% or less that of a typical metal, appropriate to ionic fluids and semiconductors. In all planets, the Coriolis force is dynamically important, but slow rotation may be more favorable for a dynamo than fast rotation. The maintenance and persistence of convection appears to be easy in gas giants and ice-rich giants, but is not assured in terrestrial planets because the quite high electrical conductivity of iron-rich cores guarantees a high thermal conductivity (through the Wiedemann-Franz law), which allows for a large core heat flow by conduction alone. In this sense, high electrical conductivity is unfavorable for a dynamo in a metallic core. Planetary dynamos mostly appear to operate with an internal field ∼(2 ρΩ/ σ) {\textless}SUP{\textgreater}1/2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} where ρ is the fluid density, Ω is the planetary rotation rate and σ is the conductivity (SI units). Earth, Ganymede, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and maybe Mercury have dynamos, Mars has large remanent magnetism from an ancient dynamo, and the Moon might also require an ancient dynamo. Venus is devoid of a detectable global field but may have had a dynamo in the past. The presence or absence of a dynamo in a terrestrial body (including Ganymede) appears to depend mainly on the thermal histories and energy sources of these bodies, especially the convective state of the silicate mantle and the existence and history of a growing inner solid core. Induced fields observed in Europa and Callisto indicate the strong likelihood of water oceans in these bodies.},

Therefore, planetary magnetism could have a significant effect on the long-term maintenance of atmosphere and liquid water on rocky exoplanets. We use Olson \& Christensen's (2006) model to estimate magnetic dipole moments of rocky exoplanets with radii Rp ≤ 1.23 R⊕. Even when modelling maximum magnetic dipole moments, only Kepler-186 f has a magnetic dipole moment larger than the Earth's, while approximately half of rocky exoplanets detected in the circumstellar habitable zone have a negligible magnetic dipole moment.

However, in spite of several claims, conclusive evidence is still lacking. Aim. We estimate the magnetic energy available in the interaction using analytical models to provide an upper bound to the expected flare energy. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater} Methods: We investigated three different mechanisms leading to magnetic energy release. The first two can release an energy up to (0.2-1.2) B{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}2{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater}R{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}3{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/μ, where B{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}0{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} is the surface field of the star, R its radius, and μ the magnetic permeability of the plasma. These two mechanisms operate in young active stars whose coronae have closed magnetic field lines up to the distance of their close-by planets that can trigger the energy release. The third mechanism operates in weakly or moderately active stars with a coronal field with predominantly open field lines at the distance of their planets.

The Metastable Dynamo Model proposed recently by Brown, employing a stochastic transition probability from slow to more rapid spin down regimes, appears to be more successful but lacks a physical basis for such duality. Using detailed 3D MHD wind models computed for idealized multipole magnetic fields, we show that surface magnetic field complexity can provide this basis. Both mass and angular momentum losses decline sharply with increasing field complexity. Combined with observation evidence for complex field morphologies in magnetically active stars, our results support a picture in which young, rapid rotators lose angular momentum in an inefficient way because of field complexity. During this slow spin-down phase, magnetic complexity is eroded, precipitating a rapid transition from weak to strong wind coupling.},

	abstract = {Rotation evolution of late-type stars is dominated by magnetic braking and the underlying factors that control this angular momentum loss are important for the study of stellar spin-down. In this work, we study angular momentum loss as a function of two different aspects of magnetic activity using a calibrated Alfvén wave-driven magnetohydrodynamic wind model: the strengths of magnetic spots and their distribution in latitude. By driving the model using solar and modified solar surface magnetograms, we show that the topology of the field arising from the net interaction of both small-scale and large-scale field is important for spin-down rates and that angular momentum loss is not a simple function of large scale magnetic field strength. We find that changing the latitude of magnetic spots can modify mass and angular momentum loss rates by a factor of two. The general effect that causes these differences is the closing down of large-scale open field at mid- and high-latitudes by the addition of the small-scale field. These effects might give rise to modulation of mass and angular momentum loss through stellar cycles, and present a problem for ab initio attempts to predict stellar spin-down based on wind models. For all the magnetogram cases considered here, from dipoles to various spotted distributions, we find that angular momentum loss is dominated by the mass loss at mid-latitudes. The spin-down torque applied by magnetized winds therefore acts at specific latitudes and is not evenly distributed over the stellar surface, though this aspect is unlikely to be important for understanding spin-down and surface flows on stars.},

However, previous radio observations targeted known brown dwarfs discovered via their infrared emission. Here we report the discovery of BDR J1750+3809, a circularly polarized radio source detected around 144 MHz with the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope. Follow-up near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy show that BDR J1750+3809 is a cold methane dwarf of spectral type T6.5 ± 1 at a distance of \$\{65\}\_\{-8\}{\textasciicircum}\{+9\}{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrm\{pc\}\$ . The quasi-quiescent radio spectral luminosity of BDR J1750+3809 is ≍5 × 1015 erg s-1 Hz-1, which is over two orders of magnitude larger than that of the known population of comparable spectral type. This could be due to a preferential geometric alignment or an electrodynamic interaction with a close companion. In addition, as the emission is expected to occur close to the electron gyrofrequency, the magnetic field strength at the emitter site in BDR J1750+3809 is B ≳ 25 G, which is comparable to planetary-scale magnetic fields. Our discovery suggests that low-frequency radio surveys can be employed to discover substellar objects that are too cold to be detected in infrared surveys.},

We identified 156 planet candidates, including one object that was not previously identified as a Kepler Object of Interest. We inspected all publicly available follow-up images, observing notes, and centroid analyses, and corrected for the likelihood of false positives. We evaluated the sensitivity of our detection pipeline on a star-by-star basis by injecting 2000 transit signals into the light curve of each target star. For periods shorter than 50 days, we find \{0.56\}-0.05+0.06 Earth-size planets (1-1.5 R⊕) and \{0.46\}-0.05+0.07 super-Earths (1.5-2 R⊕) per M dwarf. In total, we estimate a cumulative planet occurrence rate of 2.5 ± 0.2 planets per M dwarf with radii 1-4 R⊕ and periods shorter than 200 days. Within a conservatively defined habitable zone (HZ) based on the moist greenhouse inner limit and maximum greenhouse outer limit, we estimate an occurrence rate of \{0.16\}-0.07+0.17 Earth-size planets and \{0.12\}-0.05+0.10 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. Adopting the broader insolation boundaries of the recent Venus and early Mars limits yields a higher estimate of \{0.24\}-0.08+0.18 Earth-size planets and \{0.21\}-0.06+0.11 super-Earths per M dwarf HZ. This suggests that the nearest potentially habitable non-transiting and transiting Earth-size planets are 2.6 ± 0.4 pc and \{10.6\}-1.8+1.6 pc away, respectively.

The K2 light curves yield photometrically derived rotation periods for 97 stars (79 of which without previous period measurement), as well as various measures for activity related to cool spots and flares. We find a clear difference between fast and slow rotators with a dividing line at a period of ∼10 d at which the activity level changes abruptly. All photometric diagnostics of activity (spot cycle amplitude, flare peak amplitude and residual variability after subtraction of spot and flare variations) display the same dichotomy, pointing to a quick transition between a high-activity mode for fast rotators and a low-activity mode for slow rotators. This unexplained behaviour is reminiscent of a dynamo mode-change seen in numerical simulations that separates a dipolar from a multipolar regime. A substantial number of the fast rotators are visual binaries. A tentative explanation is accelerated disc evolution in binaries leading to higher initial rotation rates on the main sequence and associated longer spin-down and activity lifetimes. We combine the K2 rotation periods with archival X-ray and UV data. X-ray, FUV and NUV detections are found for 26, 41, and 11 stars from our sample, respectively. Separating the fast from the slow rotators, we determine for the first time the X-ray saturation level separately for early- and for mid-M stars.},

Using distances obtained from Gaia DR2 parallaxes, we determined the energy of the flares to be in the range ∼1.2 × 1029-6 × 1034 erg. In agreement with previous studies we find rapidly rotating stars tend to show more flares, with evidence for a decline in activity in stars with rotation periods longer than ∼10 d. The rotational modulation seen in M dwarf stars is widely considered to result from a starspot which rotates in and out of view. Flux minimum is therefore the rotation phase where we view the main starspot close to the stellar disc centre. Surprisingly, having determined the rotational phase of each flare in our study we find none show any preference for rotational phase. We outline three scenarios which could account for this unexpected finding. The relationship between rotation phase and flare rate will be explored further using data from wide surveys such as NGTS and TESS.},

	abstract = {In this study, we considered stellar spots, stellar flares, and also the relation between these two magnetic proccesses that take place on UV Cet stars. In addition, the hypothesis about slow flares described by Gurzadyan (1986 Ap\&SS, 125, 127) was investigated. All of these discussions were based on the results of three years of observations of UV Cet-type stars: AD Leo, EV Lac, V1005 Ori, EQ Peg, and V1054 Oph. First of all, the results show that stellar spot activity occurs on the stellar surface of EV Lac, V1005 Ori, and EQ Peg, while AD Leo does not show any short-term variability and V1054 Oph does not exhibit any variability. We report on new ephemerides for EV Lac, V1005 Ori, and EQ Peg, obtained from time-series analyses. The phases, computed at intervals of 0.10 phase length, where the mean flare occurence rates to obtain maximum amplitude; also, the phases of rotational modulation were compared in order to investigate whether there is any longitudinal relation between stellar flares and spots. Although the results show that flare events are related with spotted areas on stellar surfaces during some of the observing seasons, we did not find any clear correlation among them. Finally, it was tested whether slow flares are fast flares occurring on the opposite side of the stars according to the direction of the observers, as mentioned in a hypothesis developed by Gurzadyan (1986). The flare occurence rates reveal that both slow and fast flares can occur in any rotational phases. The flare occurence rates of both fast and slow flares vary in the same way along the longitudes for all program stars. These results are not expected based on the case mentioned in the hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Phased flaring, or the periodic occurrence of stellar flares, may probe electromagnetic star-planet interaction (SPI), binary interaction, or magnetic conditions in spots. For the first time, we explore flare periodograms for a large sample of flare stars to identify periodicity due to magnetic interactions with orbiting companions, magnetic reservoirs, or rotational phase. Previous large surveys have explored periodicity at the stellar rotation period, but we do not assume periods must correspond with rotation in this work. Two-minute TESS light curves of 284 cool stars are searched for periods of 1-10 days using two newly developed periodograms. Because flares are discrete events in noisy and incomplete data, typical periodograms are not well suited to detect phased flaring. We construct and test a new Bayesian likelihood periodogram and a modified Lomb-Scargle periodogram. We find six candidates with a false-alarm probability below 1\%. Three targets are ≥3σ detections of flare periodicity; the others are plausible candidates that cannot be individually confirmed. Periods range from 1.35 to 6.7 days and some, but not all, correlate with the stellar rotation period or its 1/2 alias. Periodicity from two targets may persist from TESS Cycle 1 into Cycle 3. The periodicity does not appear to persist for the others. Long-term changes in periodicity may result from the spot evolution observed from each candidate, which suggests magnetic conditions play an important role in sustaining periodicity.},

Using 37.6 days of monitoring data from 2014 to 2015, we have detected 66 individual flare events, the largest number of white-light flares observed to date on Proxima Cen. Flare energies in our sample range from 1029 to 1031.5 erg. The flare rate is lower than that of other classic flare stars of a similar spectral type, such as UV Ceti, which may indicate Proxima Cen had a higher flare rate in its youth. Proxima Cen does have an unusually high flare rate given its slow rotation period, however. Extending the observed power-law occurrence distribution down to 1028 erg, we show that flares with flux amplitudes of 0.5\% occur 63 times per day, while superflares with energies of 1033 erg occur ∼8 times per year. Small flares may therefore pose a great difficulty in searches for transits from the recently announced 1.27 M ⊕ Proxima b, while frequent large flares could have significant impact on the planetary atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Proxima b is a terrestrial-mass planet in the habitable zone of Proxima Centauri. Proxima Centauri’s high stellar activity, however, casts doubt on the habitability of Proxima b: sufficiently bright and frequent flares and any associated proton events may destroy the planet’s ozone layer, allowing lethal levels of UV flux to reach its surface. In 2016 March, the Evryscope observed the first naked-eye-brightness superflare detected from Proxima Centauri. Proxima increased in optical flux by a factor of ∼68 during the superflare and released a bolometric energy of 1033.5 erg, ∼10× larger than any previously detected flare from Proxima. Over the last two years the Evryscope has recorded 23 other large Proxima flares ranging in bolometric energy from 1030.6 to 1032.4 erg; coupling those rates with the single superflare detection, we predict that at least five superflares occur each year. Simultaneous high-resolution High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectroscopy during the Evryscope superflare constrains the superflare’s UV spectrum and any associated coronal mass ejections. We use these results and the Evryscope flare rates to model the photochemical effects of NO x atmospheric species generated by particle events from this extreme stellar activity, and show that the repeated flaring may be sufficient to reduce the ozone of an Earth-like atmosphere by 90\% within five years; complete depletion may occur within several hundred kyr. The UV light produced by the Evryscope superflare would therefore have reached the surface with ∼100× the intensity required to kill simple UV-hardy microorganisms, suggesting that life would have to undergo extreme adaptations to survive in the surface areas of Proxima b exposed to these flares.},

New light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission for this star allow precise stellar activity characterization over more than a decade timescale. We have carried out the first flare and starspot analysis of GJ 1243 from over 50 days of data from TESS Sectors 14 and 15. Using 133 flare events detected in the 2 minute cadence TESS data, we compare the cumulative flare frequency distributions, and find the flare activity for GJ 1243 is unchanged between the Kepler and TESS epochs. Two distinct starspot groups are found in the TESS data, with the primary spot having the same rotational period and phase as seen in Kepler. The phase of the secondary spot feature is consistent with the predicted location of the secondary starspot and measurement of weak differential rotation, suggesting this secondary spot may be long-lived and stable in both latitude and longitude. As expected for this highly active star, the constant spot and flare activity reveal no sign of solar-like activity cycles over 10 yr. However, we highlight the unique ability for Kepler and TESS to use flare rates to detect activity cycles.},

	abstract = {A survey of 28 stars (22 active binary systems, plus six single stars or wide binaries for comparison) using extreme ultraviolet spectra has been conducted to establish the structure of stellar coronae in active binary systems from the emission measure distribution (EMD), electron densities, and scale sizes. Observations obtained by the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer satellite (EUVE) during 9 years of operation are included for the stars in the sample. EUVE data allow a continuous EMD to be constructed in the range logTe(K){\textasciitilde}5.6-7.4, using iron emission lines. These data are complemented with IUE observations to model the lower temperature range [logTe(K){\textasciitilde}4.0-5.6]. Inspection of the EMD shows an outstanding narrow enhancement, or ``bump'' peaking around logTe(K){\textasciitilde}6.9 in 25 of the stars, defining a fundamental coronal structure. The emission measure per unit stellar area decreases with increasing orbital (or photometric) periods of the target stars; stars in binaries generally have more material at coronal temperatures than slowly rotating single stars. High electron densities (Ne{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1012 cm-3) are derived at {\textasciitilde}logTe(K){\textasciitilde}7.0 for some targets, implying small emitting volumes. The observations suggest the magnetic stellar coronae of these stars are consistent with two basic classes of magnetic loops: solar-like loops with maximum temperature around logTe(K){\textasciitilde}6.3 and lower electron densities (Ne{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}109-1010.5 cm-3), and hotter loops peaking around logTe(K){\textasciitilde}6.9 with higher electron densities (Ne{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1012 cm-3). For the most active stars, material exists at much higher temperatures [logTe(K){\textgreater}=6.9] as well. However, current ab initio stellar loop models cannot reproduce such a configuration. Analysis of the light curves of these systems reveals signatures of rotation of coronal material, as well as apparent seasonal (i.e., year-to-year) changes in the activity levels.},

Flaring and quiescent states of extreme ultraviolet spectra (λλ70-740) and light curves (λλ75-175) have been analyzed to provide emission measure distributions (EMD) for these systems in the range logTe(K){\textasciitilde}5.6-7.4, based principally on iron lines. Flux measurements obtained with IUE and the Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (ORFEUS) complete the EMD in the lower temperature range [logTe(K){\textasciitilde}4.0-5.6]. Frequent flaring activity has been found in the systems, including an increase during the rise phase by a factor of {\textasciitilde}9 in the flux of σ Gem, the largest flare enhancement observed with EUVE. Analyses of the EUVE emission in the active single star AB Dor and the low-rotation giant star β Cet are also included. The EMDs are remarkably similar among all the stars, showing a narrow enhancement or ``bump'' around logTe(K){\textasciitilde}6.9. These narrow bumps are apparently unrelated to rotation rate, spectral type, binarity, or evolutionary stage. Significant material is found at logTe(K){\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}7.0 for the most active stars. Modulation of the EUV flux outside of flaring occurs in four of the stars (σ Gem, V711 Tau, UX Ari, AB Dor). The electron density ranges between Ne{\textasciitilde}1012 and {\textasciitilde}1013 cm-3, measured at logTe(K){\textasciitilde}7.0, and may reach higher values during flares.

We investigate its electron density by taking into account all radiation processes in the flare loops, i.e., the Thomson continuum, hydrogen Paschen and Brackett recombination continua, as well as free-free continuum emission. We derive a quadratic function of the electron density for a given temperature and effective loop thickness. By absolutely calibrating SDO/HMI intensities, we convert the measured intensities into electron density at each pixel in the loops. For a grid of plausible temperatures between cool (6000 K) and hot (106 K) structures, the electron density is computed for representative effective thicknesses between 200 and 20,000 km. We obtain a relatively high maximum electron density, about 1013 cm-3. At such high electron densities, the Thomson continuum is negligible and therefore one would not expect a significant polarization degree in dense loops. We conclude that the Paschen and Brackett recombination continua are dominant in cool flare loops, while the free-free continuum emission is dominant for warmer and hot loops.},

Their white-light (WL) continuum emission has been interpreted as being produced by heated ribbons. In this paper, we compute the WL emission from overlying flare loops depending on their density and temperature and show that, under conditions expected during superflares, the continuum brightening due to extended loop arcades can significantly contribute to stellar flux detected by Kepler. This requires electron densities in the loops of 1012-1013 cm-3 or higher. We show that such densities, exceeding those typically present in solar-flare loops, can be reached on M-dwarf and solar-type superflare stars with large starspots and much stronger magnetic fields. Quite importantly, the WL radiation of loops is not very sensitive to their temperature and thus both cool as well as hot loops may contribute. We show that the WL intensity emergent from optically thin loops is lower than the blackbody radiation from flare ribbons, but the contribution of loops to total stellar flux can be quite important due to their significant emitting areas. This new scenario for interpreting superflare emission suggests that the observed WL flux is due to a mixture of the ribbon and loop radiation and can be even loop-dominated during the gradual phase of superflares.},

During primary eclipse, High Resolution Camera count rates decrease by {\textasciitilde}40\%. A similar minimum is seen during one primary eclipse observed by EUVE but not in others owing to intrinsic source variability. Little evidence for secondary eclipses is present in either the X-ray or EUV data, reminiscent of earlier X-ray and EUV observations. Primary eclipses allow us to estimate the extent of a spherically symmetric corona on the primary G star of about 1.3 R ⊙, or 0.86 R sstarf, and indicate that the G star is likely brighter than the K component by a factor of 2-5. Brightness changes not attributable to eclipses appear to be dominated by stochastic variability and are generally non-repeating. X-ray and EUV light curves cannot therefore be reliably used to reconstruct the spatial distribution of emission assuming that only eclipses and rotational modulation are at work. Moderate flaring is observed, where count rates increase by up to a factor of three above quiescence. Combined with older ASCA, Einstein, EXOSAT, ROSAT, and BeppoSAX observations, the data show that the level of quiescent coronal emission at X-ray wavelengths has remained remarkably constant over 33 yr, with no sign of variation due to magnetic cycles. Variations in base level X-ray emission seen by Chandra over 13 yr are only {\textasciitilde}10\%, while variations back to pioneering Einstein observations in 1980 amount to a maximum of 45\% and more typically about 15\%.},

This star is a spectroscopic binary (K2 V + K5 V) and shows signs of strong magnetic surface activity including a spot-modulated optical light curve. The flare was seen only during its decay phase but is still one of the strongest ever recorded from a T Tauri star with a peak luminosity LX = 1032.4 ergs s-1 (0.5-10 keV), a maximum temperature of at least 42 million K, and energy release {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1037 ergs. A shorter ASCA observation taken five months later showed V773 Tau in a quiescent state (LX = 1031.0 ergs s-1) and detected variable emission from the infrared binary IRAS 04113+2758. The differential emission measure (DEM) distribution during the V773 Tau flare shows a bimodal temperature structure that is almost totally dominated by hot plasma at an average temperature of {\textasciitilde}37 million K. Using information from time-resolved spectra, we examine the flare decay in terms of solar flare models (cooling loops and two-ribbon flares) and also consider possible nonsolar behavior (interbinary flares, star-disk flares, and rotational X-ray modulation). Solar models are unable to reproduce the unusual convex-shaped X-ray light curve, which decays slowly over a timespan of at least 1 day. However, the light curve decay is accurately modeled as a sinusoid with an inferred X-ray period of 2.97 days, which is nearly identical to the optical rotation period(s) of the two K-type components. This provides tantalizing evidence that the flaring region was undergoing rotational occultation, but periodic X-ray variability is not yet proven since our ASCA observation spans only one-third of a rotation cycle.},

	abstract = {Most stellar flares' soft X-ray light curves possess a 'typical' morphology, which consists of a rapid rise followed by a slow exponential decay. However, a study of 216 of the brightest flares on 161 pre-main-sequence stars, observed during the Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project (COUP), showed that many flare light curves depart from this typical morphology. While this can be attributed to the superposition of multiple typical flares, we explore the possibility that the time-variable eclipsing of flares by their host stars may also be an important factor. We assume each flare is contained within a single, uniform plasma density magnetic loop and specify the intrinsic variation of the flare's emission measure with time. We consider rotational eclipse not only by the star itself, but also by circumstellar discs and flare-associated prominences. Based on this simple model, we generate a set of flares similar to those observed in the COUP data base. Many eclipses simply reduce the flare's maximum emission measure or decay time. We conclude therefore that eclipses often pass undetected, but usually have only a modest influence on the flare emission measure profile and hence the derived loop lengths. We show that eclipsing can easily reproduce the observed atypical flare morphologies. The number of atypical modelled flare morphologies is, however, much less than that found in the COUP sample. The large number of observed atypical flare morphologies, therefore, must be attributed to other processes such as multiple flaring loops.},

Recently, the concentration of magnetic flux near the poles of these stars has been proposed as an alternative mechanism to dynamo saturation in order to explain the saturation of angular momentum loss. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Aims: In this work we study the effect of magnetic surface flux distribution on the coronal field topology and angular momentum loss rate. We investigate if magnetic flux concentration towards the pole is a reasonable alternative to dynamo saturation. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Methods: We construct a 1D wind model and also apply a 2-D self-similar analytical model, to evaluate how the surface field distribution affects the angular momentum loss of the rotating star. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: From the 1D model we find that, in a magnetically dominated low corona, the concentrated polar surface field rapidly expands to regions of low magnetic pressure resulting in a coronal field with small latitudinal variation. We also find that the angular momentum loss rate due to a uniform field or a concentrated field with equal total magnetic flux is very similar. From the 2D wind model we show that there are several relevant factors to take into account when studying the angular momentum loss from a star. In particular, we show that the inclusion of force balance across the field in a wind model is fundamental if realistic conclusions are to be drawn from the effect of non-uniform surface field distribution on magnetic braking. This model predicts that a magnetic field concentrated at high latitudes leads to larger Alfvén radii and larger braking rates than a smoother field distribution. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Conclusions: From the results obtained, we argue that the magnetic surface field distribution towards the pole does not directly limit the braking efficiency of the wind.},

	abstract = {In a study of Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating spectra of Algol, we clearly detect Doppler shifts caused by the orbital motion of Algol B. These data provide the first definitive proof that the X-ray emission of Algol is dominated by the secondary, in concordance with expectations that the primary B8 component should be X-ray-dark. However, the measured Doppler shifts are slightly smaller than might be expected, implying an effective orbital semimajor axis of about 10 Rsolar instead of 11.5 Rsolar for the Algol B center of mass. This could be caused by a small contribution of Algol A, possibly through accretion, to the observed X-ray flux, in which case such a contribution does not exceed 10\%-15\%. We suggest that the more likely explanation is an asymmetric corona biased toward the system center of mass by the tidal distortion of the surface of Algol B. A detailed analysis of the profiles of the strongest lines indicates the presence of excess line broadening amounting to approximately 150 km s-1 above that expected from thermal motion and surface rotation. Possible explanations for this additional broadening include turbulence, flows or explosive events, or rotational broadening from a radially extended corona. We favor the latter scenario and infer that a significant component of the corona at temperatures less than 107 K has a scale height of order the stellar radius. This interpretation is supported by the shape of the X-ray light curve and tentative detection of a shallow dip at secondary eclipse. We also examine the O VII intercombination and forbidden lines in a Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrograph observation and find no change in their relative line fluxes as the system goes from quadrature to primary eclipse. Since these lines appear to be strongly affected by UV irradiation from Algol A through radiative excitation of the 23S--{\textgreater}23P transition, this supports the conjecture that the corona of Algol B at temperatures of several million kelvins must be significantly extended and/or located toward the poles to avoid being shadowed from Algol A during primary eclipse.},

	abstract = {We obtain contemporaneous observations of the surface and corona of AB Doradus (AB Dor), a young single cool star, using ground-based circularly polarized spectra from the Anglo-Australian Telescope and X-ray light curves and spectra from the Chandra satellite. The ground-based data are used to construct surface magnetic field maps, which are extrapolated to produce detailed models of the quiescent corona. The X-ray data serve as a new test for the validity of these coronal models. We find that AB Dor's X-ray corona must be concentrated close to its surface, with a height, H {\textasciitilde} 0.3-0.4 R* this height is determined by the high coronal density and complex multipolar magnetic field from the surface maps. There is also significant correlation between the positions of surface and coronal active longitudes as determined from the surface spot and magnetic field maps and the X-ray light curve. At this epoch (2002 December) AB Dor appears to possess one very large active longitude region, covering almost half the star; displaying enhanced activity in the form of large dark spots, strong magnetic fields and chromospheric emission. This is unusual as previous surface maps of AB Dor typically display more active regions that span a wider range of longitudes. Finally, the level of rotational modulation and shape of the X-ray light curve depend on the distribution of magnetic field in the obscured hemisphere (AB Dor is inclined by 60°). The models that best reproduce the rotational modulation observed in the contemporaneous Chandra X-ray light curve and spectra require the magnetic field in the obscured hemisphere to be of the same polarity as that in the observed hemisphere. The Sun shows different behaviour, with the leading polarity reversed in the opposite hemisphere. The X-ray observations provide a unique constraint on the magnetic structure in the obscured hemisphere.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of 12.2 Ms of Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE) photometry of 16 RS CVn systems (including four flaring megaseconds). Our study attempts a systematic categorization of stellar coronal emission in RS CVn binary systems. The temporal resolution of the EUVE satellite and the opportunity for long observations enables us to study separately the quiescent and flaring states of RS CVn systems. Thirty of 31 observations are statistically variable. We examine light curves, characterizing both phase-dependent variations and large- and small-scale flaring. There is evidence for small-scale stochastic variability on the one short-period (Porb{\textless}1 day) system in our sample (ER Vul), which we interpret as small-scale flaring. CF Tuc is the only system for which phase-dependent variations over multiple orbital periods are seen. We analyze 30 flares on nine systems, fitting rise and decay times. Several flares have durations {\textgreater}0.5Porb and thus cannot originate from compact emission regions close to the stellar surfaces. Many flares have unusual flare morphologies, with rise times comparable to or greater than the decay time, and emission plateaus. In addition, eight flares have decay phases that are fit better by a broken power law than a single power law. The decay times for the second power law are statistically different than the single decay times and are correlated with the flare rise times. This observed connection points to the potential importance of the change in decay rate as a means of examining the physical processes operating during the flare. The distribution of orbital phases of flare onsets on V711 Tau (HR 1099), the best-studied RS CVn in our sample, is consistent with a Poisson distribution that is random in time. In two systems that are partially eclipsing (CF Tuc and ER Vul), we find no evidence for an eclipse in the light curve, indicating that the emission region is large compared to the stellar radius. We parameterize the distribution of flare energies as a power law, finding a cut-off energy of {\textasciitilde}1033 ergs and a slope of -0.6. Flare energy increases with flare duration as E{\textasciitilde}Δt1.42, confirming the long-duration nature of high-energy flares on RS CVn systems. The integrated flare luminosity depends on the quiescent luminosity as Lflare{\textasciitilde}L1.05quiescent. Flare frequencies range from 0.1 day-1 to 1.5 day-1. For observations not affected by the dead spot on the Deep Survey detector, 40\% of the observed time was spent in a flaring state, indicating that flaring is a ``normal'' state for the coronae of these systems. We note the presence of a quasi-periodicity in EUVE photometric data on the order of 1 day, which is not corrected for in the standard reduction and analysis software.},

This information cannot be derived by analyzing the decay of the flares, a frequently used approach in the literature that requires the assumption of a physical model.

The method simulates all possible geometrical situations that can produce the times of the four contacts of the eclipse. As an approximation we assume that the emitting region has a spherical shape that remains unchanged during the eclipse. We show, however, that this is a good approximation for the problem. {\textless}BR /{\textgreater}Results: The solutions observed indicate that in two of the three cases the flare cannot be polar ({\textbar}θ{\textbar} \&lt; 55°) and in a third one the flare can be placed either near the pole or at other latitudes.

Their temporal, spectral, and statistical properties present a treasury of physical information about stellar magnetic fields. The spatial distributions of magnetic spots and associated flaring regions help constrain dynamo theories. Moreover, flares are thought to crucially affect the habitability of exoplanets that orbit these stars. Measuring the location of flares on stars other than the Sun is challenging due to the lack of spatial resolution. Here we present four fully convective stars observed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite that displayed large, long-duration flares in white-light which were modulated in brightness by the stars' fast rotation. This allowed us to determine the loci of these flares directly from the light curves. All four flares occurred at latitudes between 55° and 81°, far higher than typical solar flare latitudes. Our findings are evidence that strong magnetic fields tend to emerge close to the stellar rotational poles for fully convective stars, and suggest that the impact of flares on the habitability of exoplanets around small stars could be weaker than previously thought.},
